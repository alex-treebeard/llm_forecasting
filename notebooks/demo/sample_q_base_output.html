        <div class="question-description"><p>As of 1. June the Ukrainian spring counteroffensive has not yet happened. In preparation for this counter offensive, the Ukrainian army allegedly has formed several new battalions, several of them with western tanks and AFVs. Accordingly, the Russian side has reacted to this threat by building defensive fortifications in territories it controls. The counteroffensive itself seems to be quite imminent or might have already even have begun.
As the city of Polohy is about 20 km from the frontline and in the direction towards which it is "most obvious" the counteroffensive would take place towards it is apparent to ask - will the Ukrainian army manage to retake Polohy with this summer offensive?</p>

While Russia’s defensive fortifications are impressive in their size and scale—at least in some respects—they are likely insufficient to prevent Ukrainian forces from breaking through Russian lines and retaking territory illegally seized by Russia. In short, Russian defensive actions do not guarantee that the defense has the advantage. Several steps could shift the advantage to the offense.

Weakness of Defensive Forces

Fortifications are only as good as the forces defending them. In the 1930s, France constructed the Maginot Line, which included concrete fortifications, machine guns, anti-tank emplacements, and even underground railways. The Maginot Line had state-of-the-art living conditions for specialist units of infantry, artillery, and engineers—even including air conditioning. But the French military was relatively weak. It had a debilitated air force and a large army that was unprepared for offensive operations, though it had a reasonably strong navy.[19] Germany exploited these French weaknesses during its invasion of France in 1940.

The Russian military—especially the army—has been battered over the past year. Following its February 2022 invasion, Russia failed to achieve many of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor combined arms operations; ineffective joint operations, such as close air support to Russian ground forces; problematic intelligence, including faulty Federal Security Service planning and analysis; significant logistical problems; and low morale. These factors were vital for Ukraine’s lightning offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in 2022, where Ukrainian forces achieved operational surprise, broke through Russian lines, and captured a key logistical hub to trigger a collapse among Russian ground forces and the liberation of more than 12,000 square kilometers of territory.[20]

The deployment of Wagner Group private military contractors to the front lines in eastern Ukraine in 2023 has further highlighted the poor performance of Russian ground forces, as well as the political risks of a full-scale Russian mobilization. Consequently, a partially bruised and demoralized Russian army sits behind the extensive fortifications, which may present opportunities for Ukraine.

Furthermore, the Russian military likely does not have enough high-quality forces to defend all parts of the line. The 70 combat regiments and brigades Russia has in Ukraine will likely not be sufficient to form a large mobile reserve, even if Russia commands enough soldiers to adequately staff its fortifications.[21] The lack of a strong mobile reserve means that Russia will be hard-pressed to surge forces to fill gaps in its lines, station forces in second-echelon defensive positions, and conduct counterattacks according to its defensive doctrine.[22]

Expansive Front Line

Ukraine can use the extensive front line to its advantage. Territory can be important, particularly the size of a front and the territory an attacker is attempting to seize. While the Maginot Line in France covered approximately 450 kilometers, it did not cover every inch of French territory or key parts of France’s border with Belgium and Luxembourg. Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium in May 1940. Later that month, German forces penetrated the Maginot Line at a weak part along the Belgian frontier, where France’s defenses had few forces that were of relatively low quality. On May 15, 1940, Heinz Guderian’s XIX Panzer Corps broke through the French line and headed west into open country, sealing France’s fate.[23]

One historical lesson for Ukraine and its Western supporters is to continue assessing weak spots in the Russian lines where there are opportunities for penetration, where Russian defenses are poorly constructed or of insufficient depth, and where Russian forces are understaffed or of particularly poor quality.[24] Ukrainian forces know this terrain well, since it is land many of their soldiers grew up on.

The formidable appearance of Russia’s defensive fortifications may also obscure as much as it reveals. Russia has used contractors to dig trenches, many of whom likely lack significant military engineering experience.[25] There have also been reports of Russian mistreatment of these contractors.[26] Lack of expertise or low morale could lead to the fortifications being less effective than they appear in satellite imagery.

Variation in the quality of Russia’s dragon’s teeth is notable, despite the media attention they have generated as a symbol of Russia’s defenses in Ukraine. These obstacles are most effective when connected to one another by concrete linkages underground and partially buried. Some images appear to show dragon’s teeth without underground connections. Other images appear to show dragon’s teeth sitting on top of the earth rather than partially under it. One image posted on several Russian websites also appears to show that some of the dragon’s teeth used by Russia are not entirely made of concrete and are already suffering environmental damage in Ukraine.[27] It is impossible to draw sweeping conclusions about the overall quality of Russia’s defenses from these images, but they are enough to suggest that there are variations in the quality of defenses across the line that can be exploited by Ukraine with good intelligence.

The Ukrainian front covers roughly 1,000 kilometers—more than double the size of the Maginot Line—as it zigzags from the grassy slopes of the northeast, hugs the Dnipro River, and extends to the Black Sea.[28] This large front is likely a major vulnerability for the Russians. As one assessment of the offense-defense balance concludes, “If the attacker is faced with a defender who is protecting a narrow front, the probability that the blitzkrieg will succeed is much less than if the attacker can strike at a defender deployed across a broad front.”[29] This challenge is often called the force-to-space ratio.[30] Russia likely lacks the force-to-space ratio to defend such an expansive territory.

The May 2023 clashes between Russian security forces and fighters in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, near the Ukrainian border, likely worsened Russia’s deployment problems by forcing the Russian military to move troops to its internationally recognized border with Ukraine.[31] These types of attacks could increase Russia’s force-to-space ratio problems by thinning out its defensive positions in some areas.

Technology and Military Innovation

Technology can impact the offense-defense balance. The offense generally requires mobility.[32] The attacker must first achieve a breakthrough by defeating or destroying a section of the defender’s front, and then it must exploit this breakthrough to advance into the defender’s rear.[33] As noted earlier in this analysis, advances in military mobility have sometimes shifted the balance in favor of the offense.[34]

The Ukrainian military has thus far been innovative in its development and use of technology.[35] Military innovation involves a change in the conduct of warfare intended to improve the ability of a military to generate combat power. A change in the conduct of warfare does not necessarily require a change in military doctrine, but it does involve change at the operational level of war.[36]

One example of Ukrainian innovation has been the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in combined arms warfare, which includes the blending of infantry, direct and indirect fire, aviation, and other joint capabilities to achieve political and military objectives.[37] Ukraine has utilized UASs to conduct several types of missions as part of combined arms warfare, such as target identification for artillery, strike, battlefield damage assessment, and information operations.[38]

The challenge for Ukraine will be to innovatively utilize technology and adapt its conduct of warfare in ways that maximize mobility to exploit Russian vulnerabilities. For example, Ukrainian forces could use a combination of advanced technology and UASs or loitering munitions—including those supplied by the West—to conduct UAS “swarms” against Russian defensive positions. As interviews with Ukrainian military officials indicate, Ukraine is investing significant time and resources into innovations such as swarming tactics designed to maximize target saturation and overwhelm Russian defenses.[39] UASs could also be employed to probe for gaps in Russian lines, locate Russian reserves or artillery systems, or provide artillery-like effects in support of high-mobility units exploiting a breakthrough.

An important technological obstacle to Ukraine’s efforts is Russia’s electronic warfare capabilities. Russia has effectively used electronic warfare to combat Ukrainian UASs.[40] The ability of the Ukrainian military to find and destroy Russian electronic warfare systems, which are now organic to units at multiple levels, will be a key enabler of offensive success.

Strategy, Force Employment, Will to Fight, and Other Intangibles

Attackers can make up for a tough defense with clever strategies, effective force employment, leadership, nationalism, will to fight, combat motivation, morale, and other factors. Force employment, for example, includes how militaries use force on the battlefield—a combination of cover, concealment, dispersion, suppression, small-unit independent maneuver, and combined arms operations.[41] Some also call this “military skill,” which describes a country’s ability to effectively employ military technology, including designing military strategy and assessing adversaries’ forces and strategy.[42]

Will to fight and nationalism can influence the offense-defense balance, and neither have been in short supply among Ukrainians. To the extent that soldiers are motivated by nationalism, they frequently become willing to fight harder for territory that they understand to be part of their national homeland.[43] The Ukrainian military and civilians have shown an extraordinary will to fight since the start of the war.

The reverse is also true: soldiers who are not imbued with a nationalist consciousness may be less willing to fight for territory. Confederate soldiers deserted the Army of Northern Virginia at the Potomac in 1862 because “they felt that they were fighting to defend Virginia’s soil, not to invade the North.”[44] In addition, Hitler was unwilling to risk imposing full war mobilization on Germany until the failure of Operation Barbarossa opened the possibility that Germany’s own homeland security might be threatened.[45]

Despite President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that Ukraine is part of the Russian empire, it is unclear how much this argument has convinced Russian soldiers and contractors. Recent research on absent without leave (AWOL) cases in Russian military courts suggests that an increasing number of Russian military personnel are not convinced. AWOL cases in the first four months of 2023 already surpassed the total number of cases in 2022.[46] It is impossible to say definitively that the rise indicates that Russians in Ukraine have a low will to fight, but it is hardly an indicator of a strongly motivated military.

A clever strategy is also important. Between 1919 and 1945, an evolving offensive doctrine (blitzkrieg) and motorized armor shifted the advantage to the offense and overrode machine guns, trenches, railroads, and barbed wire.[47] As B.H. Liddell Hart explained in analyzing German General Heinz Guderian’s blitzkrieg into France in May 1940:

"It is clear that Guderian and his tankmen pulled the German Army along after them, and thereby produced the most sweeping victory in modern history.

The issue turned on the time factor at stage after stage. French countermovements were repeatedly thrown out of gear because their timing was too slow to catch up with changing situations, and that was due to the fact that the German van kept on moving faster than the German high command had contemplated."[48]

In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel Defense Forces heavily relied on armor and air forces to destroy significant components of the Egyptian and Syrian air forces. Within three days, the Israelis captured the Gaza Strip and all of the Sinai Peninsula up to the east bank of the Suez Canal. Israeli forces then drove Jordanian troops out of East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank and seized the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel developed an effective blitzkrieg strategy that relied on armor to inflict a decisive defeat against its Arab adversaries. As Moshe Dayan explained to Israel’s Ministerial Defense Committee before the war, “If we opened the attack and effected an armored breakthrough into Sinai, the enemy would be forced to fight according to the moves we made.”[49]

For Ukraine today, maneuver warfare demands a flexible command structure with soldiers capable of exercising initiative in combat situations. It is not based on a rigid plan that commanders need to follow closely.[50] Ukrainian soldiers at the platoon, company, and battalion levels have already shown a proclivity to taking the initiative. In World War II, the German military developed a doctrine of Auftragstaktik, which dictated that commanders be given a battlefield objective rather than lengthy orders that micromanaged how they do it.[51] This doctrine helped enable implementation of blitzkrieg, which requires lower-level commanders to act quickly and decisively in order to exploit breakthroughs and maintain the momentum required to avoid enemy counterattack.

A clever Ukrainian strategy that penetrates Russian lines could have significant follow-on effects. For example, a major breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia could severely threaten the viability of Russia’s land bridge linking Russia’s Rostov region with Crimea. Even a breakthrough in the less-densely defended Luhansk Oblast could provide significant benefits by proving that Western support for Ukraine continues to bear fruit, removing Russian units from the battlefield, and sowing further dissent within Russia itself.

Next Steps

The next phase of the war will hinge, in part, on the ability of Ukrainian forces to retake territory by moving from attrition to maneuver warfare and to shift the offense-defense balance in favor of the offense. As Napoleon wrote, “The strength of an army, like power in mechanics, is estimated by multiplying the mass by the velocity.”[52] A Ukrainian maneuver strategy places a premium on the second factor—velocity. Russian forces have attempted to shift the advantage to the defense and retain the territory they have conquered in Ukraine by constructing a formidable system of fortifications. But Russia faces several challenges in holding this territory, including weak ground forces that have not performed well on the battlefield, the need to defend a massive amount of territory, and variable construction of the fortifications.

This war is far from over. Western aid—including weapons systems, technology, training, intelligence, and financial support—will be critical over the long run to help Ukraine retake its territory and prevent Russia from invading again in the foreseeable future. The future trajectory of the war will also depend on whether Ukraine can exploit Russian vulnerabilities and effectively integrate technology, a clever strategy, force employment, nationalism, and other factors to turn the tide.

Email Icon Save Layered Russian defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines Advancing Ukrainian troops must break through an elaborate network of Russian defences running hundreds of miles across the country that were built in anticipation of Kyiv’s offensive. With the initial assaults now underway, new satellite imagery provided to The Telegraph by Maxar Technologies has revealed the array of minefields, anti-tank ditches, and trenches lying ahead of the Ukrainian troops attempting to push south. The defences, according to a Ukrainian intelligence officer, are constructed in a “three-line system”, with varying levels of fortifications, the depths of which can exceed around 19 miles on some axes. “They have unbelievable trenches and unbelievable fortifications, it will be hard to break their lines of defence” Serhii, a commander in Ukraine’s National Guards, told The Telegraph. “There are also minefields and they have good artillery - more than us unfortunately.” These layered defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines separating Ukrainian forces from the Russian occupiers. For more than six months, Ukraine has been preparing 12 new offensive brigades, including nine armed and trained by Nato nations, for the task at hand. This time has given Russia ample time to build fortifications in the areas most likely expected to be targeted by Kyiv - occupied Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s south and the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east. One of the new satellite images shows trenches carefully carved into agricultural land outside the town of Mykhailivka, around 40 miles west of Tokmak, where Ukrainian forces are reportedly making a push. Russia’s fortifications in southern Ukraine The carefully-constructed ditches stretch for miles across a series of farmers’ fields, serving as a rear defensive position on the lands occupied by Moscow’s forces. In a sign of Russian caution, the array of trenches seen in the images are positioned almost 19 miles behind the current front lines. Other satellite images show deep trenches just in front of a tree line, which is then used to disguise artillery positions that can strike approaching forces. Ukrainian soldiers prepare for battle on the front line south of Bakhmut Credit : Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Closer to the front, Moscow’s forces have deployed triangular concrete blocks known as “dragons’ teeth” in a bid to slow Ukrainian armour in any attempted push south. One satellite image taken in March shows hundreds of the anti-tank structures arranged in rows, as well as personnel trenches, just east of Vaylivka, a city which sits on a road junction heading towards occupied Melitopol. And ahead of those, while not visible to the satellite, would likely be a vast network of minefields aimed at stopping any initial drive south by Ukrainian troops. The layered defensive system Ukrainian troops must break through “The first line, along the line of contact, comprises the fighting positions made by the infantry,” according to a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute. “The second constitutes properly made trenches as compared with fox holes in the first – and concrete firing posts where possible. “Several obstacle belts are laid in front of these positions, usually formed with a 4m deep and 6m wide anti-tank ditch, dragons’ teeth and wire track entanglements. “The depth of defence is usually 5km from the first, and each belt of physical defences tends to span between 700m and a kilometre, so that the entire obstacle series is covered by fire. “The third line usually comprises full-back fighting positions and concealed areas for reserves, with positions dug for vehicles.” Ukrainian soldiers wade through floodwater in Afanasiyivka following the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam this week Credit : OLEKSII FILIPPOV/AFP/Getty Images British intelligence officials have described the Russian efforts to fortify their positions as “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world”. Recent analysis of these positions suggest they could stretch across the entire front line from occupied Crimea to the Donbas. Ukrainian troops have even grown to admire their enemy’s ability to construct trenches, an admission that the counter-offensive is unlikely to be as easy as some observers expect. “We should learn from our enemy on how they construct their trenches, because they are so excellent at that,” Serhii, the intelligence officer, said. “They use specialised vehicles, not only hands.” License this content Advertisement More stories</div></td>

Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to think so. "We can definitely state that this Ukrainian offensive has begun," he said in a video interview published on Telegram on Friday. In some ways, it's already been under way for weeks, with Ukraine conducting what's known in military jargon as "shaping operations": long range artillery and missile attacks on key Russian logistical targets far behind the front lines. Monday seemed to herald a change, with small detachments of lightly armoured Ukrainian units moving forward across the open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine, south-east of Zaporizhzhia. "Now the so-called 'fighting reconnaissance stage' is taking place along the entire length of the front," Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told the BBC. "That means there's a probing of Russian defences." Some videos and accounts suggested that they quickly ran into trouble. "Somewhere this happens more successfully with small losses," Mr Kuzan said. "And somewhere less successfully, where the Russians fight back." Mr Kuzan declined to name specific towns, saying only that they were all in the area south of Zaporizhzhia. By Tuesday, the world's attention was captured by the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and the subsequent flooding that soon covered around 230 square miles (596 sq km) either side of the Dnipro River. For all the Kremlin's denials, it didn't look like a coincidence. The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance. It seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table. Kyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once. In late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson. The extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known, and is now academic. The catastrophic flooding will have made river crossings impossible for the time being. "But the fact that such a direction was an option was seen by the Russians," Mr Kuzan said. Image source, EPA Image caption, The burst dam has caused catastrophic flooding across southern Ukraine While the authorities in Kyiv suddenly grappled with the flooding, the fighting continued - and seemed to escalate - further east. By early Thursday morning, the UK's Ministry of Defence tweeted, external that "heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front," adding that in most areas "Ukraine holds the initiative." In a video the same day, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Russian forces had repelled an overnight Ukrainian attack in the area south of Zaporizhzhia, involving 150 armoured vehicles and 1,500 troops. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, Ukraine's 47th Mechanised Brigade "made an attempt to break through Russian lines." A video circulated on the internet, purporting to show something new: a western-supplied Leopard tank being destroyed. The BBC has not yet verified the video. Ukrainian officials, characteristically tight lipped about current operations, offered tantalising glimpses into what was going on. Hanna Malyar, the Deputy Defence Minister, coyly said that Russian troops were "actively on the defensive" in the area around the town of Orikhiv, around 65km south-east of Zaporizhzhia. In a statement on Telegram, she also confirmed that battles were continuing around Velyka Novosilka, further east. The two towns likely form the western and eastern edges of a heavily fortified stretch of the front line where many analysts believe Ukraine will eventually try and punch through Russian lines. "It's not a secret that one of our main goals is to cut the land corridor that feeds the whole southern grouping of enemy forces," Mr Kuzan said. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Ukrainian forces want to cut the Russian-held land corridor to Crimea Pro-Russian Telegram channels in the Donbas were full of excited chatter about Ukraine's latest moves, much of it laced with scorn. "They are going where the Russians are waiting for them," one member posted in the I Love Kramatorsk group. "What stupidity!" Others acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had moved forward, but questioned the price in lost men and armour. "I really question the price of this success," another member of the same group commented. "Do they have enough forces to reach Tokmak [44km south of Orikhiv], let alone Berdyansk and Melitopol?" But it's not the only area where fighting is raging. Footage from north and south of the city of Bakhmut, scene of one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the war, appeared to show Ukrainian forces moving forward. Ms Malyar said they had advanced "from 200 to 1,100 metres in various sections," in what may eventually be an effort to encircle the city and trap its Russian occupiers. It is, as the UK's Ministry of Defence noted, "a highly complex operational picture". But does it mean that Ukraine's counter-offensive is already entering a dramatic new phase? On Wednesday, Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, scoffed at the idea. "All of this is not true," he told Reuters. "When we start the counter-offensive, everyone will know about it. They will see it." Image source, Reuters Image caption, The air war - including the use of drones - will be vital for Ukraine's counteroffensive But something has definitely changed. "The point is that the front is finally moving," Serhii Kuzan said, adding that several options were still open to Ukrainian commanders. But Ukraine is also operating under a number of significant restraints, the main one being the lack of fighter jets capable of providing support from the air. "That's why we move slowly," Mr Kuzan said, "and then move air defence [systems] closer." Another factor is time. This offensive will probably last no more than five months, after which autumn rain will once again render open ground impassable for heavy armoured vehicles. What will success look like? If Ukrainian forces can punch through Russian lines, all the way to the Sea of Azov, then any Russian troops west of that breach will suddenly be much more vulnerable, dependent entirely on supply lines through the Crimean Peninsula. All that would then remain, Mr Kuzan says, would be to destroy the Kerch Bridge linking Russia with Crimea (briefly disabled by a huge truck bomb last October) and attack ships and planes being used to ferry supplies to the peninsula. "That would be the end," he says. "But don't expect this to happen soon. It'll take months." Related Topics War in Ukraine

The Ukrainian army's success in retaking Polohy by the 1st of October, 2023, will depend on their ability to punch through Russian lines and the effectiveness of their military operations.

There are statements everywhere that Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive is underway, which is causing some excitement and trepidation. The offensive is incredibly important for Ukraine’s future.

But when assessing what’s actually happening, it’s useful to understand some key facts. There is a big difference between starting an offensive, and the main attack or main effort of the operation. The offensive has clearly started, but not I think the main attack.

When we see large, armored formations join the assault, then I think we’ll know the main attack has really begun. To date, I don’t think we’ve witnessed this concentration of several hundred tanks and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) in the attack.

A Ukrainian tank battalion normally has 31 tanks. An armored infantry battalion would have about the same number. Add in armored vehicles carrying engineers, air defense, logistics, and so on. An armored brigade would likely have three tank battalions and one or two mechanized infantry battalions. In total, then, an armored brigade is going to have 250-plus armored vehicles of different types.

I estimate that the Ukrainians have put together anywhere from seven to 12 armored brigades. Some may have only Ukrainian or captured Russian equipment, and others will have a mix of Western-provided kit.

When we see two or three of those brigades (around 500-750 armored vehicles) focused on a narrow front, it will then be possible to say that the main attack has probably started and where it’s happening. But even then, be careful. The Ukrainian General Staff will want to keep the Russians guessing about the location of the main attack for as long as possible, and they won’t be too bothered (and will probably welcome) Twitter getting it wrong.

How Russia has fortified parts of Ukraine ahead of a possible counteroffensive Defensive fortifications have sprung up along, behind and sometimes far removed from the front lines.

If the West provides everything the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) need, especially long-range precision weapons, then I still anticipate that Ukraine can liberate Crimea, the decisive terrain of this war, by the end of this summer, that is to say, by the end of August. This is one of the aims of the offensive, I believe. At that point, the UAF’s long-range precision weapons could reach Sevastopol, Saky, Dzankoy, and other key Crimean targets, and that would allow them to make the peninsula untenable for Russian forces. That’s why the UK’s delivery of Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles with a range of 155-plus miles, was such an important contribution.

I hope the Biden Administration will finally relent and give short-range (up to 300km or 186 miles) ground-to-ground ATACMS ballistic missiles to Ukraine. That would mark a decisive contribution to what Ukrainian forces can achieve on the ground by giving the offensive an enormous boost.

Some have dated the start of this campaign to June 4, two days before Russia’s sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnipro River on June 6. That was likely the moment when General Valerii Zaluzhny, the UAF commander-in-chief, decided — in my view — that his three preconditions had been met and that he could therefore give the green light. He would have asked:

Is there enough combat power (armored brigades with tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, engineers, artillery, air defense and logistics) to be able to penetrate the Russian linear defenses and achieve their assigned tasks, which probably includes cutting the “land bridge” from Russia to Crimea, and also securing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?;

Have Russian defenses and logistics been sufficiently degraded; has the Russian rear area and transportation network been adequately disrupted; and are the Russian leadership confused enough as to the aim and timings of the UAF offensive?; and

Is the ground dry enough to support the movement of hundreds of heavy, tracked, armored vehicles?

Lined up in defensive positions before the UAF assault units are the Russians, sitting behind hundreds of miles of trenches with bunkers, minefields, anti-tank ditches, and “Dragons Teeth” obstacle belts. But these defenses are only as good as the soldiers occupying them and covering those obstacles. I’m not impressed with the fighting capabilities of the Russians in most places, and the vicious in-fighting we see between the various Russian leaders, (e.g., warlords like Prigozhin and Kadyrov) highlights the lack of cohesion on the Russian side. I imagine the UAF will exploit this.

How Russia has fortified parts of Ukraine ahead of a possible counteroffensive Russian defensive fortifications have sprung up along, behind and sometimes far removed from the front lines.

So far, it seems that the Ukrainians are still probing, pressing, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit, reinforcing local tactical success where they find or create it. That's one of the benefits of their adoption of Western-style tactical command and control where lower-level leaders can make decisions on their own. And some of what we are seeing is intended, perhaps, to confuse the Russians as to where the main attack will eventually be delivered. To show a Leopard on the battlefield at such an early stage was probably, in my view, intended to draw a lot of attention to that area, perhaps as a decoy. I cannot know that, but it's something I would have done, given all the attention in the media about these excellent tanks.

As always, those taking part in the fighting face not only enemy deception but also the sheer confusion of combat. The fog of war really does affect commanders in the field. I always had great difficulty visualizing and understanding what was going on during a fight — as a brigade commander and corps chief of operations in Iraq, and later as Director of Operations in Kandahar, Afghanistan — even though we had the latest command and control systems. A commander is still dependent on the reports from forward commanders actually engaged at the battle area’s forward edge. Drones help give some overview, but it's still a challenge. That's why it is essential to trust subordinate commanders to understand the overall plan and continue making good decisions in the heat of battle.

Even so, there are going to be losses. The destruction of a single Leopard caused a lot of excitement on Twitter, but it was actually recovered from the battlefield so that it could be repaired and put back in the fight. That's impressive. It's what we practice in the US Army, and it’s worth noting the UAF’s achievement in doing the same.

There is much uncertainty, but of one thing we can be sure — the Ukrainian General Staff has done a superb job protecting information in order to prevent the Russians from knowing what's happening and enabling them to prepare for the attack.

The uncertainty in Russian minds may have been one reason for their sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam. Quite apart from its horrific humanitarian and ecological consequences, the flooding of low ground and widening of the Dnipro may have delayed UAF offensive operations in that area for a time. But there are expert voices saying the floodwaters will subside within the next five to seven days, and the ground will rapidly begin to dry in the summer heat. So the likely intended effect hoped for by the Russian side — of making crossings of the Dnipro harder — is probably going to be relatively short-lived.

Meanwhile, I have no trust whatsoever about any report from the Russian side on the dam’s demolition or about anything happening on the line of contact. The Ukrainians, of course, are very disciplined in protecting information and are also very good at controlling the narrative. We’ll know more soon.

So what does Ukraine need as it engages in this great national effort? It needs advocates, and it badly needs ATACMS.

The Ukrainian leader, at a Kyiv news conference alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, responded to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comment a day earlier that Ukraine’s counteroffensive had started — and Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses.”

Zelenskyy said that “the counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.”

“I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders. “Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.”

Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since devastating floods caused by a breach in a Dnieper River dam, offered up monetary, military and moral support. He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375 million) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6 billion) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5 million) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response.

Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war,” but he didn’t blame Moscow directly.

Ukraine’s General Staff said Saturday that “heavy battles” were ongoing, with 34 clashes over the previous day in the country’s industrial east. It gave no details but said Russian forces were “defending themselves” and launching air and artillery strikes in Ukraine’s southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.

Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was underway, though some Western analysts have said fiercer fighting and reported use of reserve troops suggests it was. Recent Western injections of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment — some of it high-tech and top-of-the-line — to Ukraine has raised expectations about when it would be used, and to what effect against dug-in Russian lines.

For months, Ukrainian commanders in the eastern city of Bakhmut — which was largely devastated in a months-long fight that has been one of the bloodiest battles of the war — have used the language of counteroffensive and defensive operations to describe the activity there.

Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Friday that the epicenter of the fighting has been in the east, particularly in the Donetsk region, and cited “heavy battles” in Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Marinka.

Valerii Shershen, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s armed forces in Zaporizhzhia, told Radio Liberty that they were searching for weaknesses in Russia’s defense in that region, to the west.

Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency Energoatom said the last operating reactor at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had been placed in “cold shutdown” mode. That’s a process in which all control rods are inserted into the reactor core to stop the nuclear fission reaction and generation of heat and pressure.

The plant’s other five reactors already were in cold shutdown amid concerns about the plant’s exposure to the fighting.

Energoatom said in a statement late Friday that there was “no direct threat” to the Zaporizhzhia plant because of the breach of the Kakhovka dam further down the Dnieper River, which has forced thousands of people to flee flooding and also sharply reduced water levels in a reservoir used to help cool the facility.

WATCH: Evacuations continue in Ukraine as scope of dam disaster comes into full view

Water levels in the Kakhovka reservoir, which feed the Zaporizhzhia plant, remained stable on Saturday, Energoatom said.

The site’s power units have not been operating since September last year. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is due to visit Ukraine in the coming days.

Ukrainian authorities reported Saturday that at least six civilians have died across the country as Russian forces launched Iranian-made Shahed drones, missiles, and artillery and mortar strikes.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported that three people were killed and more than two dozen wounded overnight in an attack targeting the Black Sea port of Odesa. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern operational command, Natalia Humeniuk, said two children and a pregnant woman were among those wounded.

Two people were killed in a Russian attack on the town of Orekhova in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to governor Yuriy Malashko.

In Ukraine’s northeast, a 29-year-old man was killed as more than 10 drones targeted the Kharkiv region, its governor, Oleh Syniehubov, reported Saturday. He added that at least three other civilians were wounded.

The Ukrainian air force said that during the night, it had shot down 20 out of 35 Shahed drones and two out of eight missiles “of various types” launched by Russian forces.

The fighting and civilian casualties took renewed attention as authorities in southern Ukraine said water levels have been declining in a vast area beneath the ruptured dam.

Nearly one-third of protected natural areas in the Kherson region could be obliterated by flooding following the breach of the Kakhovka dam, the Ukrainian environment minister warned Saturday.

The U.N.’s humanitarian aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said in an Associated Press interview Friday that an “extraordinary” 700,000 people were in need of drinking water.

In other developments:

On Saturday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he wants to continue speaking with Putin — whose order for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been criticized by many Western leaders — and plans to do so again “soon.” Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since the invasion.

The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops. “That’s needs to be understood,” he said.

The U.K. government said it will give 16 million pounds ($20 million) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding. Most of the money is being channelled through international organizations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations, and the U.K. is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine.

The U.K. has already given Ukraine 1.5 billion pounds in economic and humanitarian support since the war began, the government said, and has committed 4.6 billion pounds in military aid.

What Ukraine Has Lost As Ukraine Launches Counteroffensive, Definitions of ‘Success’ Vary Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Share full article



Ukrainian forces firing at Russian positions in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine on Wednesday. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Julian E. Barnes and June 10, 2023 After months of anticipation, Ukraine’s forces — newly trained on complex warfare tactics and armed with billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weaponry — launched operations on multiple fronts in the past week in an effort to dislodge entrenched Russian military units, a counteroffensive that many officials in the United States and Europe say could be a turning point in the 15-month war. Much rides on the outcome. There is little doubt the new military drive will influence discussions of future support for Ukraine as well as debates about how to guarantee its future. What remains unclear, though, is exactly what the United States, Europe and Ukraine view as a “successful” counteroffensive. Publicly, American and European officials are leaving any definition of success to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. For now, Mr. Zelensky has not laid out any public goals, beyond his oft-stated demand that Russian troops must leave the whole of Ukraine. He is known as a master communicator; any perception that he is backing off that broad ambition would risk undermining his support at a critical moment. Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Still, two themes emerge as clear ideas of “success”: that the Ukrainian army retake and hold on to key swaths of territory previously occupied by the Russians, and that Kyiv deal the Russian military a debilitating blow that forces the Kremlin to question the future of its military options in Ukraine. Some battlefield success, whether by decimating Russia’s army, claiming some territory or both, could help Kyiv secure additional military aid from Europe and the United States. It would also build confidence in allied capitals that their strategy of remaking Ukraine’s forces into a Western-style military is working. And most importantly, such an outcome would build more support in Europe for some sort of long-term security guarantee for Kyiv and strengthen Ukraine’s hand at a bargaining table. Success is not guaranteed. Throughout the war, the Ukrainian army, with deeply motivated troops, creative military operations and advanced Western weaponry, has outperformed Russia’s military. But the Ukrainians have also found it difficult to dislodge the Russians from their entrenched defensive positions in the last few months, with the front lines barely moving.

Few military campaigns have been as anticipated in recent memory as the current Ukrainian counteroffensive that appears to be underway. For months, speculation built over when and how Ukraine’s forces would strike back across the front lines in the south and east of their country. Kyiv shared little publicly about its plans to retake territory seized in the Russian invasion, though it clamored for Western tanks, infantry vehicles and other sophisticated military aid as it made its preparations.

Spring began to melt into summer. The brutal fighting over the eastern city of Bakhmut captured attention; so, too, the incessant barrage of Russian missiles and drones on civilian areas of Ukraine, including cities far from the main battlefields of the war. The specter of a nuclear escalation loomed darkly over the conflict. And in the past week, we saw a new horror — man-made ecological devastation, as a suspected Russian attack on the Kakhovka reservoir dam along the Dnieper River led to widespread flooding and the evacuation of thousands of civilians.

But now it seems Ukraine is on the march. Though coy on the details, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed as much at a news conference Saturday alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Analysts have concluded that significant operations are in motion on at least three key fronts: Eastward over the bloodied terrain surrounding Bakhmut and toward occupied Luhansk; southeast into the Donetsk region; and southward into parts of the Zaporizhzhia region controlled by Russian troops and toward the Sea of Azov.

Russia has heavily fortified this latter approach, as Ukrainian success there would spell strategic disaster for the Kremlin. “The flat fields of Zaporizhzhia were long seen as a likely and advantageous focal point for the counterattack,” my colleagues explained. “By cutting through here, Kyiv could sever the ‘land bridge’ between mainland Russia and Crimea. This would cut off Russia’s east-west supply lines.”

The region’s “position at the heart of the frontline means that any attack there could trap large numbers of Russian troops in a pocket to the west, in Kherson province,” noted the Economist. “Many could also be trapped in Crimea itself, if Ukraine managed to strike the bridge over the Kerch strait again.” The British magazine added that Ukraine just getting into artillery range of some of the rail and road links to the annexed peninsula would trigger a crisis for Russia.

Political risks rise for Putin as Ukraine’s counteroffensive begins

Ukraine and its allies hope that the superior firepower and training of new Western-backed armored brigades will break through Russia’s reinforced lines. Experts, though, reckon the fighting will be more akin to the attritional slog that preceded Ukraine’s liberation of Kherson than the lightning campaign that routed Russian forces in Kharkiv.

“This isn’t something you judge based on a few days of fighting,” tweeted Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, downplaying social media hand-wringing over published Russian images of a handful of smoldering Ukrainian tanks. “Footage of combat losses, which are to be expected, can have an anchoring effect. The offensive will play out over weeks, and likely months.”

The end goal for Kyiv is a commanding position from which to turn and face the Kremlin: “If this counteroffensive is indeed successful, the Ukrainians will not only liberate more of their land from a brutal occupation but also might cause more Russians to accept that this is a war they cannot win and persuade the West to keep providing the support Ukraine needs for the long term,” wrote Post columnist Max Boot.

Another Post columnist, David Ignatius, likened the operations to D-Day in World War II and to other offensives in history that serve as “a reminder that an army must sometimes take huge risks to position itself for eventual victory.”

The potent U.S. arsenal for Ukraine’s counteroffensive

Ukraine’s leader is fully aware of the stakes. Amid fears of Western fatigue and, in particular, waning U.S. support as elections draw near, Kyiv wants to show that the significant American and European outlay to buttress its war effort has been worth it — and is also worth sustaining.

“Look, nobody expects as much [from this counteroffensive] as we do,” Zelensky told my colleagues in an interview last month. “I’ll tell you frankly, I’m not sure that absolutely all of our partners believe that we are able to break the Russian Federation.”

Ukraine’s political and security future will be at the heart of discussions next month at a NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius — where months of complicated wrangling over Kyiv’s potential membership in the military alliance and other security guarantees that can be extended to the besieged Ukrainians may come to a head. Within Europe, there are also varying views on how far Ukraine should be encouraged to wage its campaigns before entering negotiations with Russia.

“I know that there is skepticism among some partners that it would be scary if Ukraine liberates absolutely all of its territories,” Zelensky told The Post. “But I, for example, can live with this skepticism. And I believe that the more victories we have on the battlefield, frankly, the more people will believe in us, which means we will get more help.”

Ukraine’s counteroffensive is underway. Here’s what’s at stake.

The Ukrainian counteroffensive also adds to the pressures on the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin has seen the “special military operation” he launched last year sprawl into a ruinous war that has deepened Russia’s geopolitical isolation and gravely depleted its military capacity. Erstwhile supporters now openly challenge the logic and strategy that compelled the invasion, while bracing for worse news to come.

“If Russia loses the corridor to Crimea, it will be a very serious blow,” Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of R-Politik, a political analysis firm with insight into Russia’s halls of power, told my colleagues. “Everyone understands how important it is for Putin and it will mean Putin has again not calculated the situation correctly and again not managed the situation. It will mean a very serious failure.”</div></td>

Kenzo Tribouillard | AFP | Getty Images NATO allies condemned Russia for its decision to withdraw from a key arms treaty enacted at the end of the Cold War that aimed to create a military balance between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries and lower weapons stocks. In its statement, NATO called the landmark Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) "a cornerstone of Europe's security architecture," describing the treaty's role in establishing "legally binding and verifiable limits on key categories of conventional military equipment" for the countries involved. "Russia has for many years not complied with its CFE obligations, in particular by ceasing its implementation of the CFE Treaty without a legal basis in 2007. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and Belarus' complicity, is contrary to the objectives of the CFE Treaty," NATO said. It called Russia's pullout from the treaty "the latest in a series of actions that systematically undermines Euro-Atlantic security" and that it "further demonstrates Moscow's continued disregard for arms control, including reciprocity, transparency, compliance and verification." — Natasha Turak Reports of drone strike on Russian city, people injured A drone strike hit the southern Russian city of Voronezh and three people were wounded, regional governor Alexander Gusev said.

Who destroyed the dam and why is still not fully clear, although growing evidence points to deliberate Russian action. As the shockwaves of Tuesday’s Nova Kakhovka explosion wane, Ukraine is left reckoning with the damage—and trying to find words for the crime.

“Brutal ecocide,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted on Tuesday in reference to the explosion, also calling it an act of “Russian aggression,” a “war crime,” and “an act of terrorism.” Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office has launched an ecocide probe into the effects of the dam’s destruction, and climate activist Greta Thunberg is using the same term to describe the event. This is not the first time Ukrainians have used the term to describe Russian actions: Ecocide gained traction earlier this year when Ukraine hosted a panel on “prosecuting environmental war crimes” at the United for Justice conference in March.

But what does ecocide mean? A combination of “ecology” and “genocide,” the term packs a punch. By using it to call attention to wartime environmental devastation, Ukrainians are reviving a rhetorical strategy that was birthed in opposition to the Vietnam War. It has, however, no widely accepted legal meaning—although some advocates aspire to make it otherwise.

American bioethicist Arthur Galston coined the term in a 1970 plea to end the use of Agent Orange, an herbicide used by U.S. troops in Vietnam to eliminate forest cover and crops, on the grounds that it was causing widespread environmental destruction—or ecocide. In 1971, Foreign Affairs ran a piece under the title “Ecocide and the Geneva Protocol” weighing the strategic advantages of Agent Orange against its devastating environmental impact, framed as a contribution to the debate on whether the United States should ratify measures banning biochemical weapons.

“Ecocide is the willful destruction of ecology—of the environment—as a weapon of war,” said David Zierler, a historian of science and author of The Invention of Ecocide: Agent Orange, Vietnam, and the Scientists Who Changed the Way We Think About the Environment (University of Georgia Press, 2011).

Outside of a wartime context, the term is popular within the environmental movement as a tool for prosecuting corporate oil spillers and other actors who cause widespread environmental destruction. Domestic laws aimed at protecting the environment are not new, and some post-Soviet states—with histories of government-led ecological destruction—have them, though they don’t always use that term.

While ecocide laws are rare, it’s possible that it could eventually have international legal force within the specific context of war. By citing it in the same beat as “war crime” and “aggression,” Zelensky’s tweet tied the term to a conceptually and legally complex framework and showcased his high hopes that this word might become a tool for justice.

As it is used today, ecocide should not be confused with the perhaps more familiar notion of scorched-earth campaigns, which are already punishable under international law. From Roman legions “salting the earth” to destroy Carthaginian power to Iraqi soldiers spilling Kuwaiti oil into the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War, intentionally destroying the environment is a tried-and-true military tactic.

It is also liable to prosecution under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the document that lays out the definition and prosecution guardrails for crimes that can be tried under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity, the crime of aggression, and war crimes.

Although these laws have only been in effect since 2002, Marwa Daoudy, an associate professor of international relations at Georgetown University, traces the rising awareness of environmental destruction to Iraq’s actions during the Gulf War. “Since then, there’s been a realization that these acts should not be adopted by states in situations of warfare,” she said. “So this is why it’s seen as a turning point.”

Since disproportionate attack is a type of war crime and environmental damage is a type of disproportionate attack, wartime environmental damage brought on by armed forces can be prosecuted under the Rome Statute. There is even a clause that explicitly refers to it: Article 8, Section 2, point b (iv), which mentions “launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated.”

Much of the environmental destruction carried out by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, can be prosecuted by Article 8, according to two war crimes experts consulted by Foreign Policy.

“That’s the definition at the moment, which I would have thought is capable of being levied at Russian military commanders,” said Geoffrey Robertson, a former United Nations war crimes judge. “It’s there already.”

“Suggesting that attacks which cause huge damage to the environment is a war crime is obviously an important message to be sending as the prosecutor,” said Andrew Clapham, a former special representative of the U.N. secretary-general in Iraq and the author of War (Oxford University Press, 2021) and Human Rights: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2007).

So what’s the legal need for letting ecocide be its own separate crime under international law?

Article 8 requires the prosecution to prove “a lot of things,” Robertson said. If it becomes too hard to prove the case, some might come to say that that definition is not sufficient, which could suggest the need for a new concept.

Efforts to recognize ecocide as a crime under the Rome Statute are being led by the Stop Ecocide Foundation, an organization founded in 2019 that proposed to expand the statute to include ecocide. Its proposal would eliminate the need to prove a guilty mind among perpetrators, allowing cases of negligent environmental destruction to be prosecuted as ecocide.

Amending the Rome Statute would require the approval of two-thirds of the members of the ICC during an assembly meeting. While the cogs of international law reform churn slowly, national laws are moving faster, and the popularity of the term is spreading.

Outside of wartime, ecocide as such is already a crime under both Russian and Ukrainian law. The Ukrainian prosecutor-general has the power to prosecute Russian leaders if they were to be captured and proved responsible for the collapse of the dam, said legal expert Kate Mackintosh, a member of the Stop Ecocide Foundation’s independent expert panel. Kyiv defines ecocide as the “mass destruction of flora and fauna, poisoning of air or water resources, and also any other actions that may cause an environmental disaster.”

The war in Ukraine has brought global awareness to wartime environmental destruction and has since spurred government bodies to support the recognition of ecocide as a criminal offense under law, and some lawyers are confident that increased public discourse can lead to the inclusion of ecocide in governments’ national laws around the world.

“I think it’s just a matter of time before it gets accepted as an international crime, and this Ukraine situation is getting the word out there and having people talk about it, which is very important for the public consciousness,” Mackintosh said.

In March, the European Parliament proposed including ecocide as an environmental crime—though not a war crime, which only the ICC has the jurisdiction to do—under EU law.

The consequences of the dam’s destruction have already been devastating. Floodwaters submerged city blocks in Kherson; aid workers used boats to evacuate people from their houses; sewage spilled into streets lining the Dnipro, whose banks rose and washed away rich topsoil from farmland in the region. In the long term, this is particularly consequential for a country where agriculture, before the war, provided 14 percent of jobs and 41 percent of exports. The World Bank has announced that it will assess the damage, which will likely inflate its existing estimate of $411 billion to rebuild Ukraine’s economy.

Other long-term consequences, both on people and wildlife, will be difficult to measure. “We have different, let’s say, forecasts for the consequences for the environment. … We can separate [the impacts] into two zones,” said Iryna Nikolaieva, an environmental consultant at the Dutch conflict research organization PAX for Peace. Upstream, the sudden drainage of the reservoir could rapidly change the ecosystem in a process of desertification. Downstream, alongside the damage to settlements and agriculture, the floodwaters could destabilize ecosystems and jeopardize nature reserves.

Ukraine’s environment and the people who live in it will be changed by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam for years to come. It’s the likelihood that locals were deliberately targeted, and the apparent intention to cause long-lasting harm, though, that makes Zierler, the historian of science, say this is a unique moment. “I would make the case that the destruction of the dam in Ukraine is probably the most compelling instance of ecocide since the Vietnam War,” he said.</div></td>

Many Asian nations have refrained from picking sides in the war, preferring an ‘omnibalancing’ act that suits their national interests Ukraine war + FOLLOW Maria Siow + FOLLOW Published: 9:30am, 10 Jun 2023 Why you can trust SCMP Indonesian defence minister Prabowo Subianto’s peace plan for ending the war in Ukraine at the Shangri-La Dialogue last weekend triggered a backlash and was seized on by observers as a sign that countries in the Global South do not see eye to eye with the West’s “us versus them” or “good versus evil” narrative of the conflict. Many Global South countries have avoided taking sides on the war, with some also abstaining from voting at the United Nations against Russian aggression. But the ensuing economic pain and global supply chain disruptions have prompted many of these countries to adopt a more nuanced – even quid pro quo – position on a conflict that they see as undermining their national and domestic interests. Indonesian defence minister Prabowo Subianto caused a stir at the Shangri-La Dialogue defence summit in Singapore on June 3 when, in an emotionally charged speech, he put forward a controversial peace plan for the Ukraine war Prabowo proposed a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine , creating a demilitarised zone that would be guaranteed by observers and global peacekeeping forces. He also suggested an eventual “referendum in the disputed areas” organised by the United Nations “Let us not put blame on any side, there are always two versions to any conflict,” he said, stressing that a cessation of hostilities was essential. The blowback was immediate and ferocious. Indonesia’s Minister of Defence Prabowo Subianto speaks at the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on June 3. Photo: Reuters Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov dismissed the idea as sounding “like a Russian plan, not Indonesia’s plan”, while stressing that there were no “disputed” territories in which to hold a referendum. “We don’t need this mediator coming to us [with] this strange plan,” Reznikov said, while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on the international community to bring “just peace” to Ukraine, and “not a peace of surrender”. Prabowo’s plan was criticised at home, with Meutya Hafid, chair of parliament’s defence and foreign affairs commission, saying the defence minister should be careful in expressing his opinion. Indonesian President Joko Widodo also said he would summon Prabowo for an explanation. Prabowo, one of the aspiring candidates in next year’s presidential election, was likely playing to an audience wary of Western imperialism and tired of the impact of the war on food and oil prices. Observers, however, seized on Prabowo’s speech as yet another sign that the Global South – made up of developing countries – did not buy into the Western narrative framing Russia as the all-out bad guy in the war. The choice of platform – the Shangri-La Dialogue, a conclave of defence chiefs, experts and analysts on global security – made Prabowo’s audacity all the more stunning in delivering this hard truth. Prabowo’s speech had “the value of challenging the claim of only one morally correct viewpoint of the Ukraine war, that of Washington and its close allies”, said Sarang Shidore, director of studies and senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a US think tank. In an article published on the think tank’s website, Shidore said that beyond the generally accepted view that the invasion was a violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity, “there is no consensus on how to trade off peace and justice in ending this war”. “Much of the Global South believes that the pursuit of perfect justice, when increasingly impractical and extremely costly, may ultimately yield neither peace nor justice,” Shidore wrote. Middle-power countries such as Indonesia, Brazil and India were making it clear that the Global South had a stake in the world order and “will not shy from asserting their voice to participate in and shape the conversation”, he added. Indonesian President Joko Widodo visits Kyiv to meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in June last year. Photo: Reuters Indonesia’s position Indonesia, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , has traditionally maintained good relations with both Russia and Ukraine. It has not applied economic sanctions against Moscow despite voting in favour of a UN resolution condemning the invasion. Widodo even visited Ukraine and Russia last year and offered to mediate between the warring countries. Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at strategic advisory firm Global Counsel, said Prabowo’s key message was that the conflict was posing economic uncertainties for Global South countries, such as disruptions to food and fuel exports. Indonesia, which relies heavily on foreign investment to generate economic growth, is becoming increasingly worried the sanctions on Moscow could lead to the suspension of an oil refinery joint venture project with Russia in Indonesia, Dinarto said. “Therefore, Indonesia hopes that a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine could restore the pre-war situation, eliminating heavy sanctions on [Moscow],” Dinarto said. Indonesia also wanted to keep “its options open” in procuring weapons from Russia, said Yohanes Sulaiman, an associate professor of international relations at Jenderal Achmad Yani University. 01:38 ‘Fundamental obligation’: India’s foreign minister snubs Western sanctions on Russian oil ‘Fundamental obligation’: India’s foreign minister snubs Western sanctions on Russian oil ‘Strategic ambivalence’ National considerations similarly drive other Global South countries, with most of them adopting a neutral stance in a conflict viewed as a “proxy war between Russia and the West, with Ukraine the latter’s surrogate”, according to Brahma Chellaney, professor emeritus of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. Chellaney cited the example of India, whose posture of “strategic ambivalence” meant it continued to maintain ties with both Russia and the West, resisting the US push to directly oppose Moscow – its largest arms supplier and one of its largest oil providers. India had also sought to be the bridge-builder between the two warring parties. “The longer the war has raged, the more the non-Western world has refused to take sides,” Chellaney said, adding that few bought into the Western narrative that the war was a battle between democracies and autocracies. Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky was “anything but a democrat”, having previously pressured critics into silence, attempted to control the media and tried to arrest former president and opposition politician Petro O. Poroshenko on treason charges. A customer speaks with a shopkeeper selling grocery items at a market in Karachi. Pakistan is one of many countries that finds itself reluctant to criticise Russia because of trade ties. Photo: Reuters Muhammad Ali Baig, a research fellow with the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, said developing countries did not have the luxury of taking sides as doing so could “readily shrink” their scope for further action, hence the choice of neutrality. Pakistan was one such “rational actor”, he said, pointing to the country’s reluctance to criticise Russia’s actions, having purchased petroleum products from Moscow. Islamabad had also denied reports claiming it was selling arms to Kyiv, and previously said it supported Ukraine’s sovereignty. “Pakistan’s economy is dwindling and its reliance on its long-standing partner, the United States, is fading,” he said, adding that this was due to Washington’s inability to help Pakistan fix its economic woes. Earlier this year, Pakistan’s finance minister Ishaq Dar urged Washington to use its diplomatic influence to convince the International Monetary Fund to relax its tough conditions – such as amending its artificial exchange rates – on Islamabad in order to revive aid. Bangladesh initially abstained from voting on a UN resolution calling on Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine, citing Russia’s support – as the Soviet Union – during Bangladesh’s fight for independence in 1971. But in April, Dhaka shifted position by declaring that the Ukraine war had violated international law and the UN charter. Anu Anwar, a fellow at Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said that given Bangladesh’s geostrategic location at the crossroads of three nuclear-armed states in the region – India, Pakistan and China – Dhaka could have taken a bolder stand on the issues of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Noting that Bangladesh’s initial response aligned with that of most South Asian countries, Anwar said Dhaka’s change of heart was likely aimed at appeasing the West as antagonising it was “the last thing” the country needed. Motorists travel along a road in Dhaka. Antagonising the West is “the last thing” Bangladesh needs, observers say. Photo: Bloomberg Anwar pointed to recent comments by US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby urging Bangladesh to hold “free and fair elections”, scheduled for January next year. “The West has already ramped up pressure … [so] Bangladesh’s position towards the Ukraine war up until the national election will primarily be shaped by domestic politics,” he said. While sovereignty and territorial integrity are key considerations for developing countries in Asia, Anwar noted that the Ukraine war was “too distant” for them. “They also do not see much of their interest in backing up Russia overtly against the West” and had turned to “omnibalancing” both the West and Russia in ways that suited their national interests, he added. 02:14 Sri Lanka secures long-awaited US$2.9 billion IMF bailout after China-backed debt-restructuring plan Sri Lanka secures long-awaited US$2.9 billion IMF bailout after China-backed debt-restructuring plan Sri Lanka , struggling under the weight of its worst economic crisis in recent years, is another Asian nation that has refrained from condemning Russia. Neil DeVotta, politics and international affairs professor at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, said the South Asian island nation stood to gain from Russia’s support in international forums, especially when it came to allegations of war crimes against Tamils in a country that had previously been torn apart by decades of civil war. Russia had backed Sri Lanka at last year’s UN Human Rights Council, saying that Colombo was justified in cracking down on protesters who had called for the resignations of the island’s leaders. “It is also easier for smaller countries like Sri Lanka to take a neutral position when larger powers like India refuse to condemn Russia,” he added. Protesters storm the office compound of Sri Lanka’s prime minister last summer demanding that he resign after the island nation’s president had fled the country amid an economic crisis. Photo: AP DeVotta said most Global South countries had adopted a neutral position based on self-interest as war did not affect them “from a security standpoint”. More significantly, they had a growing recognition of a “burgeoning multilateral system that’s reordering the distribution of power” that was likely to lead to deglobalisation. “The initial framing of the war as a contest between democratic and autocratic forces may have also contributed to this neutral positioning,” DeVotta said, since most Global South states were non-democratic or illiberal democracies. Thailand , which initially embraced neutrality, later supported the UN resolution calling for an end to the war and demanding Russia’s immediate withdrawal. In the UN vote last year, Thailand abstained from condemning the Russian annexation of four Ukrainian regions, saying that the “increased politicisation of international principles” had become “counterproductive”. Ken Mathis Lohatepanont, a PhD student in political science at the University of Michigan, said this reflected a foreign policy that had attempted to steer the middle path and Bangkok hoped to maintain friendly ties with all major powers. “Thailand has long followed a strategy best termed as the ‘bamboo bending in the wind’,” refusing to side too firmly with one great power or another, Lohatepanont said. The Thai government had thus far been ambivalent about supporting either Russia or the Western-led coalition, he added. 03:03 Russia unleashes rare daytime strikes on Ukrainian capital Kyiv in new wave of attack Russia unleashes rare daytime strikes on Ukrainian capital Kyiv in new wave of attack Outcome uncertain In recent months, most notably at the G7 summit held in Japan , the US and its allies have called on Global South countries to support Ukraine But the muted support from many Asian countries comes as Islamic nations including Indonesia have “stronger memories” of a Western coalition’s actions in Afghanistan Iraq and Libya , said Paul Rogers, emeritus professor at Bradford University in England. According to estimates from Brown University’s Costs of War Project, at least 897,000 people around the world, including many Muslims, died in the violence that can be classified as part of the war on terror. Experts have also said a clear-cut defeat of either side in the war is unlikely, with protracted fighting leaving both parties exhausted being a more distinct possibility. Philip Breedlove, distinguished professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs in Georgia Tech, said the war “will end the way that the West wants it to end”. “The fact of the matter is when the West supplies Ukraine what it needs, it wins,” said Breedlove, formerly a commander of the US European Command. But with Global South countries divided on the war, Rogers said the ending could well involve other countries, most notably China. In recent weeks, China has sent its special envoy Li Hui, who said after a 12-day tour of Europe that it was “rather difficult” to get all parties to sit down at the negotiating table, but offered reassurances that a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict was still possible. While the Global South might not play a decisive role in the outcome of the war, which looks likely to drag on, Western powers can expect more peace plans from middle-power countries to continue emerging. “One could see the Global South dropping its neutral stance if Russia uses a nuclear weapon, [but] that aside, these countries are bound to maintain their current posture,” said Wake Forest University’s DeVotta. 116</div></td>

The Ukrainian leader made the comment on Saturday at a news conference in Kyiv, while standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He was responding to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement a day earlier that Ukraine’s counteroffensive had started and that Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses”.

Zelenskyy said that “counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.”

“I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders.

“Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.”

Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was under way, though some Western analysts have said fiercer fighting and reported use of reserve troops suggests it was.

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy provided few details while urging troops to keep fighting.

“Thank you to all those who hold their positions and those who advance,” he said, citing the eastern and southern fronts, where fighting is heaviest.

Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had repelled enemy attacks around Bakhmut and Marinka, sites of heavy clashes in the east. Russian forces, it said, “continue to suffer heavy losses which they are trying to conceal”.

Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar made it plain on Telegram that the military would issue no statements until battlefield positions became clear.

“Ask yourself this… am I prepared to receive information about the liberation of this or that town not when our troops enter it, but once they establish a stronghold?” she wrote.

Ukraine has said for months it plans to conduct a significant counteroffensive to recapture land occupied by Russia in the south and east. But it is enforcing strict operational silence for now and has denied it has begun the main operation.

With scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been difficult to assess the state of the fighting.

‘Significant’ operations

The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said Ukraine had conducted “significant” operations in several eastern and southern parts in the last 48 hours, with Russian defences breached in places.

“In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower,” it said, also characterising the Russian military’s performance as mixed.

“Some [Russian] units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields,” it said.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive is expected to use thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West but Russia has built huge fortifications in occupied territory to prepare, while Kyiv also lacks air supremacy.

Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert at the University of Bath in the UK, told Al Jazeera that the counteroffensive was likely to be a “long game” and that its initial operations would “probably be the most bloody part for the Ukrainians”.

“It’s highly unlikely that we’re going to see a rapid breakthrough like we saw in Kharkiv back in September, for example, where the Ukrainians were able to, with the help of allied intelligence, identify places where there were just exhausted and ruined Russian units and drove essentially past them and kept going. It’s not going to be like that,” he said.

“The Russians have had months to prepare significant offences and these are … defensive positions with trenches, bunkers, minefields, in particular, which are designed to channel attackers into killing zones.”

The Ukrainians were likely to take “a lot of casualties” while going on the attack.

“It’s much easier to defend: You know the ground, you know what the plan is, you know ‘I’m going to hold this position until they get to here and then I’m going to fall back to here, and then that other position is going to support me’,” Bury said.

“It’s significantly easier for the defenders as the Ukrainians found out when they were defending last year. It’s much more difficult for the attackers,” he added. “Yes, you have some intelligence preparation but you don’t know exactly where everything is; it’s all new to you, the terrain and you’re being fired on etc as you try to advance; so it’s much more difficult for them.”

The south is seen as a key strategic priority for a Ukrainian push that could aim to recapture Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and cut the Russian land bridge to the occupied Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, dividing Russian forces.

The fighting there has drawn renewed attention following the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam along the Dnipro River on Tuesday.

The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparked fears of humanitarian and environmental disasters. Ukraine says Russia blew up the dam. Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing on it.

Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since the dam’s breach, offered up monetary, military and moral support.

He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375m) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6bn) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5m) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response.

Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war”, but he did not blame Moscow directly.

In other developments, the UK government also said it will give 16 million pounds ($20m) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding.

Most of the money is being channelled through international organisations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations. The UK is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he wanted to continue speaking with Putin and plans to do so again “soon”.

Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops.

"Counter-offensive and defensive actions are taking place," he said.

But he added that he would not talk in detail about which stage or state the counter-offensive was in.

The comments come after an escalation of fighting in the south and east of Ukraine and speculation about progress of the widely anticipated push.

Ukrainian troops are reported to have advanced in the east near Bakhmut and in the south near Zaporizhzhia, and have carried out long-range strikes on Russian targets.

But assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with the two warring sides presenting contrasting narratives: Ukraine claiming progress and Russia that it is fighting off attacks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a video interview published Friday that Ukrainian forces had certainly begun their offensive but that attempted advances had failed with heavy casualties.

Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday after talks with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Mr Zelensky described the Russian leader's words as "interesting".

Ukraine live briefing: Zelensky claims ‘step-by-step’ progress in counteroffensive; Putin says Kyiv hasn’t achieved its goals Ukrainian soldiers in a combat operation in the country's east on Thursday. (Roman Chop/AP) Listen 8 min Share Add to your saved stories Save Ukrainian officials have reported fierce fighting on the front lines after their military launched its long-anticipated counteroffensive. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that “very tough battles” were raging in the eastern Donetsk region and that Ukrainian forces were seeing “step-by-step” results. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday offered his first remarks acknowledging the counteroffensive, telling reporters that the Kremlin could say with “absolute certainty” that the campaign had begun but that Ukraine had not achieved its goals. Ukraine has not made an official announcement on the counteroffensive — and has previously cautioned that no single action would mark the start of the campaign. However, Ukrainian troops intensified strikes in the southeast this week, according to four service members, The Washington Post reported. The offensive is expected to unfold over months and serve as a test of months-long efforts by the United States and Ukraine’s other Western backers to train its forces and equip them with increasingly sophisticated weapons. Advertisement Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe. Key developments Intense fighting has been reported in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, long seen as the likely focal point for Ukraine’s counterattack. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Friday that Russia is “conducting defensive operations” in the area. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, long seen as the likely focal point for Ukraine’s counterattack. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Friday that Russia is “conducting defensive operations” in the area. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said on Telegram that an attack on a hospital in Huliapole, a town near the region’s front line, killed two staff members. If Ukraine retakes Zaporizhzhia, it could disrupt critical Russian supply lines by cutting off the land route connecting Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland.

Putin pointed to the use of “strategic reserves” as evidence that the counteroffensive had begun. “On none of the sectors of the front line did the Ukrainian troops achieve the tasks assigned to them,” he said at a meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Sochi, Russia. Putin said Ukraine was suffering heavy losses but that it still retained “offensive potential.”

A senior Western intelligence official told The Post that , for now, Ukraine appeared to be holding back its most significant firepower, noting that the larger blow “hasn’t landed yet.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.

Ukraine’s military is armed with a potent U.S. arsenal. Washington has Washington has committed 90 Stryker personnel carriers and more than 100 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The Strykers and Bradleys are generally faster, more advanced and better protected than the aging Soviet and Russian vehicles that the Ukrainians operate, but they are more technically challenging to maintain in the field. The United States has also pledged 31 Abrams tanks, but they will not be ready until September at the earliest.

The situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains “precarious,” according to Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. There have been concerns over safety at the Russian-occupied plant after the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam reduced water levels in the reservoir used to supply cooling water to the plant. For now, the plant is continuing to pump cooling water from the reservoir, but it is not clear when and at what level the reservoir will stabilize, Grossi said.

While assessments of the dam collapse were still underway, the senior Western intelligence official pointed to several factors that suggested Russian culpability , namely that Russia controlled the section of dam where the hydropower unit fits into the overall structure — a vulnerable point that could have been exploited to destroy the dam, which was otherwise believed to be structurally sound. “If you have access to the inside of the dam, as they did, you can potentially exploit that vulnerability in a way someone else could not,” the official said.

Ukrainian security services on Friday released a recording of a phone conversation that they said provided evidence that Russia had sabotaged the plant. “It wasn’t them,” a voice, described by the Ukrainians as a Russian soldier, says on the recording, using an expletive to refer to the destruction of the dam. “It was our [guys].” A second soldier says, “[Our] sabotage group was there. They wanted to scare [people] with this dam. It didn’t go according to plan. It was more than they had planned.” The United States has not publicly issued any determination about what happened at the dam on Tuesday, or who — if anyone — was responsible, while Russia has claimed without evidence that Ukraine attacked the dam. Battleground updates The “situation is tense on all areas of the front,” said Maliar, the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, adding that the east is the “epicenter” of the fighting. Like Zelensky, she highlighted developments in Bakhmut. “The enemy is withdrawing reserves and trying to hold the occupied positions,” she said, adding that Ukrainian forces are “conducting active combat operations in several areas” nearby.

Ukraine and Russia accused each other of shelling people fleeing the flooding after the Kakhovka dam collapse. According to the Ukrainian governor of the region, Oleksandr Prokudin, at least one woman was killed and 17 people were injured in the flooded city of Kherson. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were “fatalities,” without giving a number.

The package includes additional munitions for the Patriot and Hawk air defense systems, artillery rounds and Puma unmanned aerial systems.

From our correspondents A Russia-Ukraine timeline: Key moments, from attack on Kyiv to counteroffensive: The start of the counteroffensive this week marks a new phase in Russia’s 16-month-long war on Ukraine. Share this article Share The war has exacted a massive toll: As many as 120,000 Ukrainian troops and 200,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded. Thousands of civilians also have died, many under flattened buildings, others shot and buried in mass graves. Whole neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble. In the past year, the war has shifted from a fast-moving, multipronged invasion to a battle of attrition concentrated along hundreds of miles of front lines. Both countries have seen their economies devastated, Ukraine’s most acutely but Russia’s, too, from the cost of military mobilizations and the weight of Western sanctions.

He is also no Pollyanna. Even while the 101st Airborne Division was rapidly advancing on Baghdad under his command in 2003, he wondered: “Tell me how this ends.”

He does not predict a rapid end to the war in Ukraine, either. Even so, the retired general returned from a visit last week to Kyiv, where he met with Ukrainian military and civilian leaders, with a positive assessment of the prospects for the Ukrainian counteroffensive that is now beginning. He told me that, while they are likely to take tough casualties in the early going, he expects “the Ukrainians to achieve significant breakthroughs and accomplish much more than most analysts are predicting.”

That is good to hear, because the Ukrainians have embarked on an extremely challenging military task. They are advancing against prepared defensive positions amply supported by artillery — and in warfare, defense always has an advantage over offense. The usual rule of thumb is that an attacking force needs 3-to-1 numerical superiority at the point of assault to succeed.

The tip of the Ukrainian spear will be the roughly eight new armored brigades — perhaps 40,000 troops in all — trained by NATO and armed with German Leopard 2 tanks and German Marder 1 infantry fighting vehicles, British Challenger 2 tanks, U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicles and more specialized vehicles akin to armored bulldozers designed to breach Russian trenches and plow through Russian minefields. Follow-on forces will need to move quickly to consolidate advances made by the shock troops in the front. (As Petraeus pointed out to me, that was “a capability that the Ukrainians lacked in their impressive offensive in Kharkiv last fall.”) Their objective will be to advance to the Sea of Azov, severing the “land bridge” between Russian-occupied Crimea and Russian-occupied Donbas.

A combined-arms offensive utilizing all the elements of military power is the most difficult undertaking in warfare, and one that the Russians singularly failed to pull off in their inept invasion of Ukraine last year. (Remember the 40-mile traffic jam of Russian vehicles outside Kyiv?) The U.S. military has gotten very good at combined-arms maneuver warfare — witness the U.S. success in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the 2003 march to Baghdad — but the Ukrainians are newcomers to this complex military art.

Moreover, the Ukrainians lack a critical element that enabled the success of U.S. forces: air superiority. The Russians don’t have it, either; neither side can consistently breach the other’s air defenses. That means that, though U.S. troops in contact with the enemy could count on “close air support,” the Ukrainians cannot. The first F-16s will not arrive in Ukraine before the fall, so Ukrainian forces will have to make do without them in this offensive.

Little wonder that even U.S. intelligence analysts have been gloomy about the prospect of Ukrainian forces staging a breakthrough. But Petraeus emailed me on Thursday: “I believe the Ukrainian commanders will eventually orchestrate very impressive combined-arms operations.” He also cautioned, however, that, as with the 2007 surge in Iraq, the fighting in the early period of the Ukrainian offensive is “going to get much harder before it gets easier.”

He spelled out what will be required: Tanks will need to advance with infantry (“to keep Russian infantry from employing anti-tank guided missiles”), engineers will need “to breach minefields and obstacles,” artillery and mortars will need to “force the Russians to keep their heads down in the trenches,” air defense systems will need to advance with the tanks and armored vehicles “to prevent Russian aircraft from supporting the Russian defenders,” electronic warfare systems will need “to jam Russian radio nets,” drones will need to find Russian headquarters and reserve forces “for targeting by precision munitions,” and, of course, logisticians will need to follow “right behind the lead elements with additional ammunition, fuel, food, water, maintenance, and medical support.” That’s a lot of elements to synchronize in the heat of battle — a process he likened to conducting a symphony orchestra.

What do the Ukrainian people think? Max Boot answered questions on his trip to Ukraine.

But Petraeus told me “it is entirely possible that Russian units — now composed increasingly of poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly led individual replacements who have been in tough combat for many months — will prove to be quite brittle and collapse over broad areas.” The Russians, he noted, will have trouble responding to Ukrainian breakthroughs, because they don’t have sufficient reserves to cover a 600-mile front. And if the Russians do try to plug one hole in the line, they might be creating other vulnerabilities elsewhere.

Petraeus said the flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday, likely by Russian forces, will not “significantly affect the Ukrainian offensive.” Indeed, some Russian positions along the Dnieper River have been flooded along with many Ukrainian communities, and once the flood waters recede, the river will actually become shallower and easier to cross.

That doesn’t necessarily mean the Ukrainians can end the war soon. As Raphael S. Cohen and Gian Gentile of the Rand Corp. warned in Foreign Policy, Americans need to get over their fixation on “short, decisive wars.” Most wars are long and grueling, and the war in Ukraine is no different. It has been going on since 2014 — not 2022 — and, no matter what happens with this counteroffensive, it will likely still be going on in 2024.

But if Petraeus is right and the Ukrainians can cut the land bridge between Donbas and Crimea, they can strike a mighty blow against the invaders. A Ukrainian advance to the Sea of Azov would put at risk Russia’s hold on Crimea, which, as Petraeus noted, is the location of “Russian air bases, headquarters, logistical depots, naval bases, and other assets” that support Russian military operations throughout Ukraine. The United States can and should help the Ukrainians by providing them, as advocated by Petraeus and many other military experts, with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to supplement the British-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles to enable longer-range strikes against Crimea.

Marc Thiessen: This is the ‘America First’ case to support Ukraine

If this counteroffensive is indeed successful, the Ukrainians will not only liberate more of their land from a brutal occupation but also might cause more Russians to accept that this is a war they cannot win and persuade the West to keep providing the support Ukraine needs for the long term.

Of course, warfare is the most complex and unpredictable of human activities and failure is always an option. But the odds in this case favor David over Goliath, because of the changes that have transformed the Ukrainian military in recent years.

Both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries are spin-offs from the Red Army. Yet since the Ukrainians started receiving Western training in 2014, they have been encouraging the kind of small-unit initiative that characterizes NATO armed forces — and that, Petraeus said, “will enable the Ukrainians to make the most of every success they achieve.” The Russians, by contrast, remain mired in the top-down, Soviet-central-planning mind-set where junior officers remain dependent on orders from higher ups — who are often far from the front and cannot respond to rapidly changing conditions.

There is also the all-important matter of differing motivations between the two sides — and, as Napoleon reportedly said, “in war, moral power is to physical as three parts out of four.” Petraeus noted that “the Ukrainians are fully mobilized, see this as their War of Independence, and have high morale.” By contrast, he pointed out, “many Russian soldiers presumably do not feel the same commitment to their cause and likely have quite poor morale after months in trenches and areas where the local citizens hate them.”</div></td>

Email Icon Save Layered Russian defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines Advancing Ukrainian troops must break through an elaborate network of Russian defences running hundreds of miles across the country that were built in anticipation of Kyiv’s offensive. With the initial assaults now underway, new satellite imagery provided to The Telegraph by Maxar Technologies has revealed the array of minefields, anti-tank ditches, and trenches lying ahead of the Ukrainian troops attempting to push south. The defences, according to a Ukrainian intelligence officer, are constructed in a “three-line system”, with varying levels of fortifications, the depths of which can exceed around 19 miles on some axes. “They have unbelievable trenches and unbelievable fortifications, it will be hard to break their lines of defence” Serhii, a commander in Ukraine’s National Guards, told The Telegraph. “There are also minefields and they have good artillery - more than us unfortunately.” These layered defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines separating Ukrainian forces from the Russian occupiers. For more than six months, Ukraine has been preparing 12 new offensive brigades, including nine armed and trained by Nato nations, for the task at hand. This time has given Russia ample time to build fortifications in the areas most likely expected to be targeted by Kyiv - occupied Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s south and the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east. One of the new satellite images shows trenches carefully carved into agricultural land outside the town of Mykhailivka, around 40 miles west of Tokmak, where Ukrainian forces are reportedly making a push. Russia’s fortifications in southern Ukraine The carefully-constructed ditches stretch for miles across a series of farmers’ fields, serving as a rear defensive position on the lands occupied by Moscow’s forces. In a sign of Russian caution, the array of trenches seen in the images are positioned almost 19 miles behind the current front lines. Other satellite images show deep trenches just in front of a tree line, which is then used to disguise artillery positions that can strike approaching forces. Ukrainian soldiers prepare for battle on the front line south of Bakhmut Credit : Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Closer to the front, Moscow’s forces have deployed triangular concrete blocks known as “dragons’ teeth” in a bid to slow Ukrainian armour in any attempted push south. One satellite image taken in March shows hundreds of the anti-tank structures arranged in rows, as well as personnel trenches, just east of Vaylivka, a city which sits on a road junction heading towards occupied Melitopol. And ahead of those, while not visible to the satellite, would likely be a vast network of minefields aimed at stopping any initial drive south by Ukrainian troops. The layered defensive system Ukrainian troops must break through “The first line, along the line of contact, comprises the fighting positions made by the infantry,” according to a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute. “The second constitutes properly made trenches as compared with fox holes in the first – and concrete firing posts where possible. “Several obstacle belts are laid in front of these positions, usually formed with a 4m deep and 6m wide anti-tank ditch, dragons’ teeth and wire track entanglements. “The depth of defence is usually 5km from the first, and each belt of physical defences tends to span between 700m and a kilometre, so that the entire obstacle series is covered by fire. “The third line usually comprises full-back fighting positions and concealed areas for reserves, with positions dug for vehicles.” Ukrainian soldiers wade through floodwater in Afanasiyivka following the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam this week Credit : OLEKSII FILIPPOV/AFP/Getty Images British intelligence officials have described the Russian efforts to fortify their positions as “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world”. Recent analysis of these positions suggest they could stretch across the entire front line from occupied Crimea to the Donbas. Ukrainian troops have even grown to admire their enemy’s ability to construct trenches, an admission that the counter-offensive is unlikely to be as easy as some observers expect. “We should learn from our enemy on how they construct their trenches, because they are so excellent at that,” Serhii, the intelligence officer, said. “They use specialised vehicles, not only hands.” License this content Advertisement More stories</div></td>

There are statements everywhere that Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive is underway, which is causing some excitement and trepidation. The offensive is incredibly important for Ukraine’s future.

But when assessing what’s actually happening, it’s useful to understand some key facts. There is a big difference between starting an offensive, and the main attack or main effort of the operation. The offensive has clearly started, but not I think the main attack.

When we see large, armored formations join the assault, then I think we’ll know the main attack has really begun. To date, I don’t think we’ve witnessed this concentration of several hundred tanks and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) in the attack.

A Ukrainian tank battalion normally has 31 tanks. An armored infantry battalion would have about the same number. Add in armored vehicles carrying engineers, air defense, logistics, and so on. An armored brigade would likely have three tank battalions and one or two mechanized infantry battalions. In total, then, an armored brigade is going to have 250-plus armored vehicles of different types.

I estimate that the Ukrainians have put together anywhere from seven to 12 armored brigades. Some may have only Ukrainian or captured Russian equipment, and others will have a mix of Western-provided kit.

When we see two or three of those brigades (around 500-750 armored vehicles) focused on a narrow front, it will then be possible to say that the main attack has probably started and where it’s happening. But even then, be careful. The Ukrainian General Staff will want to keep the Russians guessing about the location of the main attack for as long as possible, and they won’t be too bothered (and will probably welcome) Twitter getting it wrong.

How Russia has fortified parts of Ukraine ahead of a possible counteroffensive Defensive fortifications have sprung up along, behind and sometimes far removed from the front lines.

If the West provides everything the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) need, especially long-range precision weapons, then I still anticipate that Ukraine can liberate Crimea, the decisive terrain of this war, by the end of this summer, that is to say, by the end of August. This is one of the aims of the offensive, I believe. At that point, the UAF’s long-range precision weapons could reach Sevastopol, Saky, Dzankoy, and other key Crimean targets, and that would allow them to make the peninsula untenable for Russian forces. That’s why the UK’s delivery of Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles with a range of 155-plus miles, was such an important contribution.

I hope the Biden Administration will finally relent and give short-range (up to 300km or 186 miles) ground-to-ground ATACMS ballistic missiles to Ukraine. That would mark a decisive contribution to what Ukrainian forces can achieve on the ground by giving the offensive an enormous boost.

Some have dated the start of this campaign to June 4, two days before Russia’s sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnipro River on June 6. That was likely the moment when General Valerii Zaluzhny, the UAF commander-in-chief, decided — in my view — that his three preconditions had been met and that he could therefore give the green light. He would have asked:

Is there enough combat power (armored brigades with tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, engineers, artillery, air defense and logistics) to be able to penetrate the Russian linear defenses and achieve their assigned tasks, which probably includes cutting the “land bridge” from Russia to Crimea, and also securing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?;

Have Russian defenses and logistics been sufficiently degraded; has the Russian rear area and transportation network been adequately disrupted; and are the Russian leadership confused enough as to the aim and timings of the UAF offensive?; and

Is the ground dry enough to support the movement of hundreds of heavy, tracked, armored vehicles?

Lined up in defensive positions before the UAF assault units are the Russians, sitting behind hundreds of miles of trenches with bunkers, minefields, anti-tank ditches, and “Dragons Teeth” obstacle belts. But these defenses are only as good as the soldiers occupying them and covering those obstacles. I’m not impressed with the fighting capabilities of the Russians in most places, and the vicious in-fighting we see between the various Russian leaders, (e.g., warlords like Prigozhin and Kadyrov) highlights the lack of cohesion on the Russian side. I imagine the UAF will exploit this.

How Russia has fortified parts of Ukraine ahead of a possible counteroffensive Russian defensive fortifications have sprung up along, behind and sometimes far removed from the front lines.

So far, it seems that the Ukrainians are still probing, pressing, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit, reinforcing local tactical success where they find or create it. That's one of the benefits of their adoption of Western-style tactical command and control where lower-level leaders can make decisions on their own. And some of what we are seeing is intended, perhaps, to confuse the Russians as to where the main attack will eventually be delivered. To show a Leopard on the battlefield at such an early stage was probably, in my view, intended to draw a lot of attention to that area, perhaps as a decoy. I cannot know that, but it's something I would have done, given all the attention in the media about these excellent tanks.

As always, those taking part in the fighting face not only enemy deception but also the sheer confusion of combat. The fog of war really does affect commanders in the field. I always had great difficulty visualizing and understanding what was going on during a fight — as a brigade commander and corps chief of operations in Iraq, and later as Director of Operations in Kandahar, Afghanistan — even though we had the latest command and control systems. A commander is still dependent on the reports from forward commanders actually engaged at the battle area’s forward edge. Drones help give some overview, but it's still a challenge. That's why it is essential to trust subordinate commanders to understand the overall plan and continue making good decisions in the heat of battle.

Even so, there are going to be losses. The destruction of a single Leopard caused a lot of excitement on Twitter, but it was actually recovered from the battlefield so that it could be repaired and put back in the fight. That's impressive. It's what we practice in the US Army, and it’s worth noting the UAF’s achievement in doing the same.

There is much uncertainty, but of one thing we can be sure — the Ukrainian General Staff has done a superb job protecting information in order to prevent the Russians from knowing what's happening and enabling them to prepare for the attack.

The uncertainty in Russian minds may have been one reason for their sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam. Quite apart from its horrific humanitarian and ecological consequences, the flooding of low ground and widening of the Dnipro may have delayed UAF offensive operations in that area for a time. But there are expert voices saying the floodwaters will subside within the next five to seven days, and the ground will rapidly begin to dry in the summer heat. So the likely intended effect hoped for by the Russian side — of making crossings of the Dnipro harder — is probably going to be relatively short-lived.

Meanwhile, I have no trust whatsoever about any report from the Russian side on the dam’s demolition or about anything happening on the line of contact. The Ukrainians, of course, are very disciplined in protecting information and are also very good at controlling the narrative. We’ll know more soon.

So what does Ukraine need as it engages in this great national effort? It needs advocates, and it badly needs ATACMS.

The Ukrainian leader made the comment on Saturday at a news conference in Kyiv, while standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He was responding to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement a day earlier that Ukraine’s counteroffensive had started and that Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses”.

Zelenskyy said that “counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.”

“I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders.

“Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.”

Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was under way, though some Western analysts have said fiercer fighting and reported use of reserve troops suggests it was.

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy provided few details while urging troops to keep fighting.

“Thank you to all those who hold their positions and those who advance,” he said, citing the eastern and southern fronts, where fighting is heaviest.

Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had repelled enemy attacks around Bakhmut and Marinka, sites of heavy clashes in the east. Russian forces, it said, “continue to suffer heavy losses which they are trying to conceal”.

Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar made it plain on Telegram that the military would issue no statements until battlefield positions became clear.

“Ask yourself this… am I prepared to receive information about the liberation of this or that town not when our troops enter it, but once they establish a stronghold?” she wrote.

Ukraine has said for months it plans to conduct a significant counteroffensive to recapture land occupied by Russia in the south and east. But it is enforcing strict operational silence for now and has denied it has begun the main operation.

With scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been difficult to assess the state of the fighting.

‘Significant’ operations

The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said Ukraine had conducted “significant” operations in several eastern and southern parts in the last 48 hours, with Russian defences breached in places.

“In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower,” it said, also characterising the Russian military’s performance as mixed.

“Some [Russian] units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields,” it said.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive is expected to use thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West but Russia has built huge fortifications in occupied territory to prepare, while Kyiv also lacks air supremacy.

Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert at the University of Bath in the UK, told Al Jazeera that the counteroffensive was likely to be a “long game” and that its initial operations would “probably be the most bloody part for the Ukrainians”.

“It’s highly unlikely that we’re going to see a rapid breakthrough like we saw in Kharkiv back in September, for example, where the Ukrainians were able to, with the help of allied intelligence, identify places where there were just exhausted and ruined Russian units and drove essentially past them and kept going. It’s not going to be like that,” he said.

“The Russians have had months to prepare significant offences and these are … defensive positions with trenches, bunkers, minefields, in particular, which are designed to channel attackers into killing zones.”

The Ukrainians were likely to take “a lot of casualties” while going on the attack.

“It’s much easier to defend: You know the ground, you know what the plan is, you know ‘I’m going to hold this position until they get to here and then I’m going to fall back to here, and then that other position is going to support me’,” Bury said.

“It’s significantly easier for the defenders as the Ukrainians found out when they were defending last year. It’s much more difficult for the attackers,” he added. “Yes, you have some intelligence preparation but you don’t know exactly where everything is; it’s all new to you, the terrain and you’re being fired on etc as you try to advance; so it’s much more difficult for them.”

The south is seen as a key strategic priority for a Ukrainian push that could aim to recapture Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and cut the Russian land bridge to the occupied Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, dividing Russian forces.

The fighting there has drawn renewed attention following the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam along the Dnipro River on Tuesday.

The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparked fears of humanitarian and environmental disasters. Ukraine says Russia blew up the dam. Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing on it.

Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since the dam’s breach, offered up monetary, military and moral support.

He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375m) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6bn) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5m) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response.

Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war”, but he did not blame Moscow directly.

In other developments, the UK government also said it will give 16 million pounds ($20m) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding.

Most of the money is being channelled through international organisations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations. The UK is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he wanted to continue speaking with Putin and plans to do so again “soon”.

Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops.

What Ukraine Has Lost As Ukraine Launches Counteroffensive, Definitions of ‘Success’ Vary Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Share full article



Ukrainian forces firing at Russian positions in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine on Wednesday. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Julian E. Barnes and June 10, 2023 After months of anticipation, Ukraine’s forces — newly trained on complex warfare tactics and armed with billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weaponry — launched operations on multiple fronts in the past week in an effort to dislodge entrenched Russian military units, a counteroffensive that many officials in the United States and Europe say could be a turning point in the 15-month war. Much rides on the outcome. There is little doubt the new military drive will influence discussions of future support for Ukraine as well as debates about how to guarantee its future. What remains unclear, though, is exactly what the United States, Europe and Ukraine view as a “successful” counteroffensive. Publicly, American and European officials are leaving any definition of success to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. For now, Mr. Zelensky has not laid out any public goals, beyond his oft-stated demand that Russian troops must leave the whole of Ukraine. He is known as a master communicator; any perception that he is backing off that broad ambition would risk undermining his support at a critical moment. Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Still, two themes emerge as clear ideas of “success”: that the Ukrainian army retake and hold on to key swaths of territory previously occupied by the Russians, and that Kyiv deal the Russian military a debilitating blow that forces the Kremlin to question the future of its military options in Ukraine. Some battlefield success, whether by decimating Russia’s army, claiming some territory or both, could help Kyiv secure additional military aid from Europe and the United States. It would also build confidence in allied capitals that their strategy of remaking Ukraine’s forces into a Western-style military is working. And most importantly, such an outcome would build more support in Europe for some sort of long-term security guarantee for Kyiv and strengthen Ukraine’s hand at a bargaining table. Success is not guaranteed. Throughout the war, the Ukrainian army, with deeply motivated troops, creative military operations and advanced Western weaponry, has outperformed Russia’s military. But the Ukrainians have also found it difficult to dislodge the Russians from their entrenched defensive positions in the last few months, with the front lines barely moving.

"Counter-offensive and defensive actions are taking place," he said.

But he added that he would not talk in detail about which stage or state the counter-offensive was in.

The comments come after an escalation of fighting in the south and east of Ukraine and speculation about progress of the widely anticipated push.

Ukrainian troops are reported to have advanced in the east near Bakhmut and in the south near Zaporizhzhia, and have carried out long-range strikes on Russian targets.

But assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with the two warring sides presenting contrasting narratives: Ukraine claiming progress and Russia that it is fighting off attacks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a video interview published Friday that Ukrainian forces had certainly begun their offensive but that attempted advances had failed with heavy casualties.

Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday after talks with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Mr Zelensky described the Russian leader's words as "interesting".

While Russia’s defensive fortifications are impressive in their size and scale—at least in some respects—they are likely insufficient to prevent Ukrainian forces from breaking through Russian lines and retaking territory illegally seized by Russia. In short, Russian defensive actions do not guarantee that the defense has the advantage. Several steps could shift the advantage to the offense.

Weakness of Defensive Forces

Fortifications are only as good as the forces defending them. In the 1930s, France constructed the Maginot Line, which included concrete fortifications, machine guns, anti-tank emplacements, and even underground railways. The Maginot Line had state-of-the-art living conditions for specialist units of infantry, artillery, and engineers—even including air conditioning. But the French military was relatively weak. It had a debilitated air force and a large army that was unprepared for offensive operations, though it had a reasonably strong navy.[19] Germany exploited these French weaknesses during its invasion of France in 1940.

The Russian military—especially the army—has been battered over the past year. Following its February 2022 invasion, Russia failed to achieve many of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor combined arms operations; ineffective joint operations, such as close air support to Russian ground forces; problematic intelligence, including faulty Federal Security Service planning and analysis; significant logistical problems; and low morale. These factors were vital for Ukraine’s lightning offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in 2022, where Ukrainian forces achieved operational surprise, broke through Russian lines, and captured a key logistical hub to trigger a collapse among Russian ground forces and the liberation of more than 12,000 square kilometers of territory.[20]

The deployment of Wagner Group private military contractors to the front lines in eastern Ukraine in 2023 has further highlighted the poor performance of Russian ground forces, as well as the political risks of a full-scale Russian mobilization. Consequently, a partially bruised and demoralized Russian army sits behind the extensive fortifications, which may present opportunities for Ukraine.

Furthermore, the Russian military likely does not have enough high-quality forces to defend all parts of the line. The 70 combat regiments and brigades Russia has in Ukraine will likely not be sufficient to form a large mobile reserve, even if Russia commands enough soldiers to adequately staff its fortifications.[21] The lack of a strong mobile reserve means that Russia will be hard-pressed to surge forces to fill gaps in its lines, station forces in second-echelon defensive positions, and conduct counterattacks according to its defensive doctrine.[22]

Expansive Front Line

Ukraine can use the extensive front line to its advantage. Territory can be important, particularly the size of a front and the territory an attacker is attempting to seize. While the Maginot Line in France covered approximately 450 kilometers, it did not cover every inch of French territory or key parts of France’s border with Belgium and Luxembourg. Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium in May 1940. Later that month, German forces penetrated the Maginot Line at a weak part along the Belgian frontier, where France’s defenses had few forces that were of relatively low quality. On May 15, 1940, Heinz Guderian’s XIX Panzer Corps broke through the French line and headed west into open country, sealing France’s fate.[23]

One historical lesson for Ukraine and its Western supporters is to continue assessing weak spots in the Russian lines where there are opportunities for penetration, where Russian defenses are poorly constructed or of insufficient depth, and where Russian forces are understaffed or of particularly poor quality.[24] Ukrainian forces know this terrain well, since it is land many of their soldiers grew up on.

The formidable appearance of Russia’s defensive fortifications may also obscure as much as it reveals. Russia has used contractors to dig trenches, many of whom likely lack significant military engineering experience.[25] There have also been reports of Russian mistreatment of these contractors.[26] Lack of expertise or low morale could lead to the fortifications being less effective than they appear in satellite imagery.

Variation in the quality of Russia’s dragon’s teeth is notable, despite the media attention they have generated as a symbol of Russia’s defenses in Ukraine. These obstacles are most effective when connected to one another by concrete linkages underground and partially buried. Some images appear to show dragon’s teeth without underground connections. Other images appear to show dragon’s teeth sitting on top of the earth rather than partially under it. One image posted on several Russian websites also appears to show that some of the dragon’s teeth used by Russia are not entirely made of concrete and are already suffering environmental damage in Ukraine.[27] It is impossible to draw sweeping conclusions about the overall quality of Russia’s defenses from these images, but they are enough to suggest that there are variations in the quality of defenses across the line that can be exploited by Ukraine with good intelligence.

The Ukrainian front covers roughly 1,000 kilometers—more than double the size of the Maginot Line—as it zigzags from the grassy slopes of the northeast, hugs the Dnipro River, and extends to the Black Sea.[28] This large front is likely a major vulnerability for the Russians. As one assessment of the offense-defense balance concludes, “If the attacker is faced with a defender who is protecting a narrow front, the probability that the blitzkrieg will succeed is much less than if the attacker can strike at a defender deployed across a broad front.”[29] This challenge is often called the force-to-space ratio.[30] Russia likely lacks the force-to-space ratio to defend such an expansive territory.

The May 2023 clashes between Russian security forces and fighters in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, near the Ukrainian border, likely worsened Russia’s deployment problems by forcing the Russian military to move troops to its internationally recognized border with Ukraine.[31] These types of attacks could increase Russia’s force-to-space ratio problems by thinning out its defensive positions in some areas.

Technology and Military Innovation

Technology can impact the offense-defense balance. The offense generally requires mobility.[32] The attacker must first achieve a breakthrough by defeating or destroying a section of the defender’s front, and then it must exploit this breakthrough to advance into the defender’s rear.[33] As noted earlier in this analysis, advances in military mobility have sometimes shifted the balance in favor of the offense.[34]

The Ukrainian military has thus far been innovative in its development and use of technology.[35] Military innovation involves a change in the conduct of warfare intended to improve the ability of a military to generate combat power. A change in the conduct of warfare does not necessarily require a change in military doctrine, but it does involve change at the operational level of war.[36]

One example of Ukrainian innovation has been the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in combined arms warfare, which includes the blending of infantry, direct and indirect fire, aviation, and other joint capabilities to achieve political and military objectives.[37] Ukraine has utilized UASs to conduct several types of missions as part of combined arms warfare, such as target identification for artillery, strike, battlefield damage assessment, and information operations.[38]

The challenge for Ukraine will be to innovatively utilize technology and adapt its conduct of warfare in ways that maximize mobility to exploit Russian vulnerabilities. For example, Ukrainian forces could use a combination of advanced technology and UASs or loitering munitions—including those supplied by the West—to conduct UAS “swarms” against Russian defensive positions. As interviews with Ukrainian military officials indicate, Ukraine is investing significant time and resources into innovations such as swarming tactics designed to maximize target saturation and overwhelm Russian defenses.[39] UASs could also be employed to probe for gaps in Russian lines, locate Russian reserves or artillery systems, or provide artillery-like effects in support of high-mobility units exploiting a breakthrough.

An important technological obstacle to Ukraine’s efforts is Russia’s electronic warfare capabilities. Russia has effectively used electronic warfare to combat Ukrainian UASs.[40] The ability of the Ukrainian military to find and destroy Russian electronic warfare systems, which are now organic to units at multiple levels, will be a key enabler of offensive success.

Strategy, Force Employment, Will to Fight, and Other Intangibles

Attackers can make up for a tough defense with clever strategies, effective force employment, leadership, nationalism, will to fight, combat motivation, morale, and other factors. Force employment, for example, includes how militaries use force on the battlefield—a combination of cover, concealment, dispersion, suppression, small-unit independent maneuver, and combined arms operations.[41] Some also call this “military skill,” which describes a country’s ability to effectively employ military technology, including designing military strategy and assessing adversaries’ forces and strategy.[42]

Will to fight and nationalism can influence the offense-defense balance, and neither have been in short supply among Ukrainians. To the extent that soldiers are motivated by nationalism, they frequently become willing to fight harder for territory that they understand to be part of their national homeland.[43] The Ukrainian military and civilians have shown an extraordinary will to fight since the start of the war.

The reverse is also true: soldiers who are not imbued with a nationalist consciousness may be less willing to fight for territory. Confederate soldiers deserted the Army of Northern Virginia at the Potomac in 1862 because “they felt that they were fighting to defend Virginia’s soil, not to invade the North.”[44] In addition, Hitler was unwilling to risk imposing full war mobilization on Germany until the failure of Operation Barbarossa opened the possibility that Germany’s own homeland security might be threatened.[45]

Despite President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that Ukraine is part of the Russian empire, it is unclear how much this argument has convinced Russian soldiers and contractors. Recent research on absent without leave (AWOL) cases in Russian military courts suggests that an increasing number of Russian military personnel are not convinced. AWOL cases in the first four months of 2023 already surpassed the total number of cases in 2022.[46] It is impossible to say definitively that the rise indicates that Russians in Ukraine have a low will to fight, but it is hardly an indicator of a strongly motivated military.

A clever strategy is also important. Between 1919 and 1945, an evolving offensive doctrine (blitzkrieg) and motorized armor shifted the advantage to the offense and overrode machine guns, trenches, railroads, and barbed wire.[47] As B.H. Liddell Hart explained in analyzing German General Heinz Guderian’s blitzkrieg into France in May 1940:

"It is clear that Guderian and his tankmen pulled the German Army along after them, and thereby produced the most sweeping victory in modern history.

The issue turned on the time factor at stage after stage. French countermovements were repeatedly thrown out of gear because their timing was too slow to catch up with changing situations, and that was due to the fact that the German van kept on moving faster than the German high command had contemplated."[48]

In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel Defense Forces heavily relied on armor and air forces to destroy significant components of the Egyptian and Syrian air forces. Within three days, the Israelis captured the Gaza Strip and all of the Sinai Peninsula up to the east bank of the Suez Canal. Israeli forces then drove Jordanian troops out of East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank and seized the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel developed an effective blitzkrieg strategy that relied on armor to inflict a decisive defeat against its Arab adversaries. As Moshe Dayan explained to Israel’s Ministerial Defense Committee before the war, “If we opened the attack and effected an armored breakthrough into Sinai, the enemy would be forced to fight according to the moves we made.”[49]

For Ukraine today, maneuver warfare demands a flexible command structure with soldiers capable of exercising initiative in combat situations. It is not based on a rigid plan that commanders need to follow closely.[50] Ukrainian soldiers at the platoon, company, and battalion levels have already shown a proclivity to taking the initiative. In World War II, the German military developed a doctrine of Auftragstaktik, which dictated that commanders be given a battlefield objective rather than lengthy orders that micromanaged how they do it.[51] This doctrine helped enable implementation of blitzkrieg, which requires lower-level commanders to act quickly and decisively in order to exploit breakthroughs and maintain the momentum required to avoid enemy counterattack.

A clever Ukrainian strategy that penetrates Russian lines could have significant follow-on effects. For example, a major breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia could severely threaten the viability of Russia’s land bridge linking Russia’s Rostov region with Crimea. Even a breakthrough in the less-densely defended Luhansk Oblast could provide significant benefits by proving that Western support for Ukraine continues to bear fruit, removing Russian units from the battlefield, and sowing further dissent within Russia itself.

Next Steps

The next phase of the war will hinge, in part, on the ability of Ukrainian forces to retake territory by moving from attrition to maneuver warfare and to shift the offense-defense balance in favor of the offense. As Napoleon wrote, “The strength of an army, like power in mechanics, is estimated by multiplying the mass by the velocity.”[52] A Ukrainian maneuver strategy places a premium on the second factor—velocity. Russian forces have attempted to shift the advantage to the defense and retain the territory they have conquered in Ukraine by constructing a formidable system of fortifications. But Russia faces several challenges in holding this territory, including weak ground forces that have not performed well on the battlefield, the need to defend a massive amount of territory, and variable construction of the fortifications.

This war is far from over. Western aid—including weapons systems, technology, training, intelligence, and financial support—will be critical over the long run to help Ukraine retake its territory and prevent Russia from invading again in the foreseeable future. The future trajectory of the war will also depend on whether Ukraine can exploit Russian vulnerabilities and effectively integrate technology, a clever strategy, force employment, nationalism, and other factors to turn the tide.

Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to think so. "We can definitely state that this Ukrainian offensive has begun," he said in a video interview published on Telegram on Friday. In some ways, it's already been under way for weeks, with Ukraine conducting what's known in military jargon as "shaping operations": long range artillery and missile attacks on key Russian logistical targets far behind the front lines. Monday seemed to herald a change, with small detachments of lightly armoured Ukrainian units moving forward across the open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine, south-east of Zaporizhzhia. "Now the so-called 'fighting reconnaissance stage' is taking place along the entire length of the front," Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told the BBC. "That means there's a probing of Russian defences." Some videos and accounts suggested that they quickly ran into trouble. "Somewhere this happens more successfully with small losses," Mr Kuzan said. "And somewhere less successfully, where the Russians fight back." Mr Kuzan declined to name specific towns, saying only that they were all in the area south of Zaporizhzhia. By Tuesday, the world's attention was captured by the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and the subsequent flooding that soon covered around 230 square miles (596 sq km) either side of the Dnipro River. For all the Kremlin's denials, it didn't look like a coincidence. The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance. It seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table. Kyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once. In late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson. The extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known, and is now academic. The catastrophic flooding will have made river crossings impossible for the time being. "But the fact that such a direction was an option was seen by the Russians," Mr Kuzan said. Image source, EPA Image caption, The burst dam has caused catastrophic flooding across southern Ukraine While the authorities in Kyiv suddenly grappled with the flooding, the fighting continued - and seemed to escalate - further east. By early Thursday morning, the UK's Ministry of Defence tweeted, external that "heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front," adding that in most areas "Ukraine holds the initiative." In a video the same day, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Russian forces had repelled an overnight Ukrainian attack in the area south of Zaporizhzhia, involving 150 armoured vehicles and 1,500 troops. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, Ukraine's 47th Mechanised Brigade "made an attempt to break through Russian lines." A video circulated on the internet, purporting to show something new: a western-supplied Leopard tank being destroyed. The BBC has not yet verified the video. Ukrainian officials, characteristically tight lipped about current operations, offered tantalising glimpses into what was going on. Hanna Malyar, the Deputy Defence Minister, coyly said that Russian troops were "actively on the defensive" in the area around the town of Orikhiv, around 65km south-east of Zaporizhzhia. In a statement on Telegram, she also confirmed that battles were continuing around Velyka Novosilka, further east. The two towns likely form the western and eastern edges of a heavily fortified stretch of the front line where many analysts believe Ukraine will eventually try and punch through Russian lines. "It's not a secret that one of our main goals is to cut the land corridor that feeds the whole southern grouping of enemy forces," Mr Kuzan said. Image source, Reuters Image caption, Ukrainian forces want to cut the Russian-held land corridor to Crimea Pro-Russian Telegram channels in the Donbas were full of excited chatter about Ukraine's latest moves, much of it laced with scorn. "They are going where the Russians are waiting for them," one member posted in the I Love Kramatorsk group. "What stupidity!" Others acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had moved forward, but questioned the price in lost men and armour. "I really question the price of this success," another member of the same group commented. "Do they have enough forces to reach Tokmak [44km south of Orikhiv], let alone Berdyansk and Melitopol?" But it's not the only area where fighting is raging. Footage from north and south of the city of Bakhmut, scene of one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the war, appeared to show Ukrainian forces moving forward. Ms Malyar said they had advanced "from 200 to 1,100 metres in various sections," in what may eventually be an effort to encircle the city and trap its Russian occupiers. It is, as the UK's Ministry of Defence noted, "a highly complex operational picture". But does it mean that Ukraine's counter-offensive is already entering a dramatic new phase? On Wednesday, Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, scoffed at the idea. "All of this is not true," he told Reuters. "When we start the counter-offensive, everyone will know about it. They will see it." Image source, Reuters Image caption, The air war - including the use of drones - will be vital for Ukraine's counteroffensive But something has definitely changed. "The point is that the front is finally moving," Serhii Kuzan said, adding that several options were still open to Ukrainian commanders. But Ukraine is also operating under a number of significant restraints, the main one being the lack of fighter jets capable of providing support from the air. "That's why we move slowly," Mr Kuzan said, "and then move air defence [systems] closer." Another factor is time. This offensive will probably last no more than five months, after which autumn rain will once again render open ground impassable for heavy armoured vehicles. What will success look like? If Ukrainian forces can punch through Russian lines, all the way to the Sea of Azov, then any Russian troops west of that breach will suddenly be much more vulnerable, dependent entirely on supply lines through the Crimean Peninsula. All that would then remain, Mr Kuzan says, would be to destroy the Kerch Bridge linking Russia with Crimea (briefly disabled by a huge truck bomb last October) and attack ships and planes being used to ferry supplies to the peninsula. "That would be the end," he says. "But don't expect this to happen soon. It'll take months." Related Topics War in Ukraine

He is also no Pollyanna. Even while the 101st Airborne Division was rapidly advancing on Baghdad under his command in 2003, he wondered: “Tell me how this ends.”

He does not predict a rapid end to the war in Ukraine, either. Even so, the retired general returned from a visit last week to Kyiv, where he met with Ukrainian military and civilian leaders, with a positive assessment of the prospects for the Ukrainian counteroffensive that is now beginning. He told me that, while they are likely to take tough casualties in the early going, he expects “the Ukrainians to achieve significant breakthroughs and accomplish much more than most analysts are predicting.”

That is good to hear, because the Ukrainians have embarked on an extremely challenging military task. They are advancing against prepared defensive positions amply supported by artillery — and in warfare, defense always has an advantage over offense. The usual rule of thumb is that an attacking force needs 3-to-1 numerical superiority at the point of assault to succeed.

The tip of the Ukrainian spear will be the roughly eight new armored brigades — perhaps 40,000 troops in all — trained by NATO and armed with German Leopard 2 tanks and German Marder 1 infantry fighting vehicles, British Challenger 2 tanks, U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicles and more specialized vehicles akin to armored bulldozers designed to breach Russian trenches and plow through Russian minefields. Follow-on forces will need to move quickly to consolidate advances made by the shock troops in the front. (As Petraeus pointed out to me, that was “a capability that the Ukrainians lacked in their impressive offensive in Kharkiv last fall.”) Their objective will be to advance to the Sea of Azov, severing the “land bridge” between Russian-occupied Crimea and Russian-occupied Donbas.

A combined-arms offensive utilizing all the elements of military power is the most difficult undertaking in warfare, and one that the Russians singularly failed to pull off in their inept invasion of Ukraine last year. (Remember the 40-mile traffic jam of Russian vehicles outside Kyiv?) The U.S. military has gotten very good at combined-arms maneuver warfare — witness the U.S. success in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the 2003 march to Baghdad — but the Ukrainians are newcomers to this complex military art.

Moreover, the Ukrainians lack a critical element that enabled the success of U.S. forces: air superiority. The Russians don’t have it, either; neither side can consistently breach the other’s air defenses. That means that, though U.S. troops in contact with the enemy could count on “close air support,” the Ukrainians cannot. The first F-16s will not arrive in Ukraine before the fall, so Ukrainian forces will have to make do without them in this offensive.

Little wonder that even U.S. intelligence analysts have been gloomy about the prospect of Ukrainian forces staging a breakthrough. But Petraeus emailed me on Thursday: “I believe the Ukrainian commanders will eventually orchestrate very impressive combined-arms operations.” He also cautioned, however, that, as with the 2007 surge in Iraq, the fighting in the early period of the Ukrainian offensive is “going to get much harder before it gets easier.”

He spelled out what will be required: Tanks will need to advance with infantry (“to keep Russian infantry from employing anti-tank guided missiles”), engineers will need “to breach minefields and obstacles,” artillery and mortars will need to “force the Russians to keep their heads down in the trenches,” air defense systems will need to advance with the tanks and armored vehicles “to prevent Russian aircraft from supporting the Russian defenders,” electronic warfare systems will need “to jam Russian radio nets,” drones will need to find Russian headquarters and reserve forces “for targeting by precision munitions,” and, of course, logisticians will need to follow “right behind the lead elements with additional ammunition, fuel, food, water, maintenance, and medical support.” That’s a lot of elements to synchronize in the heat of battle — a process he likened to conducting a symphony orchestra.

What do the Ukrainian people think? Max Boot answered questions on his trip to Ukraine.

But Petraeus told me “it is entirely possible that Russian units — now composed increasingly of poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly led individual replacements who have been in tough combat for many months — will prove to be quite brittle and collapse over broad areas.” The Russians, he noted, will have trouble responding to Ukrainian breakthroughs, because they don’t have sufficient reserves to cover a 600-mile front. And if the Russians do try to plug one hole in the line, they might be creating other vulnerabilities elsewhere.

Petraeus said the flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday, likely by Russian forces, will not “significantly affect the Ukrainian offensive.” Indeed, some Russian positions along the Dnieper River have been flooded along with many Ukrainian communities, and once the flood waters recede, the river will actually become shallower and easier to cross.

That doesn’t necessarily mean the Ukrainians can end the war soon. As Raphael S. Cohen and Gian Gentile of the Rand Corp. warned in Foreign Policy, Americans need to get over their fixation on “short, decisive wars.” Most wars are long and grueling, and the war in Ukraine is no different. It has been going on since 2014 — not 2022 — and, no matter what happens with this counteroffensive, it will likely still be going on in 2024.

But if Petraeus is right and the Ukrainians can cut the land bridge between Donbas and Crimea, they can strike a mighty blow against the invaders. A Ukrainian advance to the Sea of Azov would put at risk Russia’s hold on Crimea, which, as Petraeus noted, is the location of “Russian air bases, headquarters, logistical depots, naval bases, and other assets” that support Russian military operations throughout Ukraine. The United States can and should help the Ukrainians by providing them, as advocated by Petraeus and many other military experts, with Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to supplement the British-provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles to enable longer-range strikes against Crimea.

Marc Thiessen: This is the ‘America First’ case to support Ukraine

If this counteroffensive is indeed successful, the Ukrainians will not only liberate more of their land from a brutal occupation but also might cause more Russians to accept that this is a war they cannot win and persuade the West to keep providing the support Ukraine needs for the long term.

Of course, warfare is the most complex and unpredictable of human activities and failure is always an option. But the odds in this case favor David over Goliath, because of the changes that have transformed the Ukrainian military in recent years.

Both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries are spin-offs from the Red Army. Yet since the Ukrainians started receiving Western training in 2014, they have been encouraging the kind of small-unit initiative that characterizes NATO armed forces — and that, Petraeus said, “will enable the Ukrainians to make the most of every success they achieve.” The Russians, by contrast, remain mired in the top-down, Soviet-central-planning mind-set where junior officers remain dependent on orders from higher ups — who are often far from the front and cannot respond to rapidly changing conditions.

There is also the all-important matter of differing motivations between the two sides — and, as Napoleon reportedly said, “in war, moral power is to physical as three parts out of four.” Petraeus noted that “the Ukrainians are fully mobilized, see this as their War of Independence, and have high morale.” By contrast, he pointed out, “many Russian soldiers presumably do not feel the same commitment to their cause and likely have quite poor morale after months in trenches and areas where the local citizens hate them.”</div></td>

Wait for the Heavy Brigades (published on 2023-06-11)<br>Summary: The social media channels are buzzing with footage of tanks and explosions in Southern and Eastern Ukraine, indicating the start of Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive. However, the main attack has not yet begun, as large armored formations have not joined the assault. The Ukrainian army is estimated to have put together seven to 12 armored brigades, some equipped with Western-provided kit. The offensive aims to liberate Crimea by the end of August, with the hope of receiving additional support from the West. The Russian side has fortified parts of Ukraine in anticipation of the counteroffensive. The Ukrainian army is still probing and reinforcing tactical successes, possibly to confuse the Russians about the location of the main attack. The Ukrainian General Staff has done a superb job protecting information to prevent the Russians from knowing what's happening. The destruction of a single tank was recovered and repaired, showcasing the army's resilience. The uncertainty in Russian minds may have been one reason for their sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam. The flooding may have delayed UAF offensive operations in that area for a time, but the effect is likely to be short-lived. The Ukrainian army needs advocates and ATACMS as it engages in this great national effort. The uncertainty and confusion in the region make it difficult to predict whether Ukraine will retake Polohy by the 1st of October, 2023.<br><br>[3] Zelenskyy says counteroffensive actions under way against Russia (published on 2023-06-11)<br>Summary: Ukraine's President Zelenskyy announced a counteroffensive against Russian forces, but details were not disclosed.

The 68th brigade reported the liberation of Blahodatne, a village in Donetsk province, 10km inside Russian-occupied territory.

Russian Defensive Fortifications: The extensive and formidable Russian fortifications outlined in Article [1], including minefields, trenches, and other barriers may significantly slow or impede Ukrainian advances, making it difficult for Ukraine to penetrate deep enough to retake Polohy by the specified date.<br>2. Russian Military Response: Russia may concentrate a significant amount of troops and firepower to repel Ukrainian advances, especially in strategic locations against obvious offensive paths. The Russian military's reaction to the Ukrainian counteroffensive may include not only defensive measures but also counter-attacks that could thwart Ukrainian progress as suggested by Article [2].<br>3. Logistical and Operational Challenges: The Ukrainian forces may encounter unforeseen logistical and operational issues, such as supply shortages, equipment failures, or harsh weather conditions that could delay the counteroffensive or reduce its effectiveness, as per the challenges discussed in converting short-term wins into larger operational successes (Article [4]).<br><br>{ Insert your thoughts }<br>Three reasons why the answer might be yes:<br>1. Ukrainian Offensive Capability: The Ukrainian military has reportedly prepared several new battalions equipped with Western tanks and AFVs (Article [2]). With these reinforcements and improvements in military capability, the Ukrainian forces might have the necessary firepower and technology to break through Russian defenses and advance towards Polohy.<br>2. Russian Defensive Weaknesses: Despite the presence of Russian fortifications, there may be weaknesses in the Russian defense that can be exploited by Ukrainian forces. Articles [7] and [8] suggest that the extensive Russian defensive fortifications and stretched front lines could create opportunities for Ukraine to find and exploit weak spots.<br>3. Ukrainian Determination and Strategy: The Ukrainian military's innovative use of technology, strategy, and high morale (Article [9]), combined with the strong will to regain territory, could drive a successful counteroffensive. Moreover, Ukrainian General Staff tactics of disinformation help keep Russian forces unprepared for the direction of the main attack, increasing the likelihood of Ukrainian success.<br><br>{ Insert your rating of the strength of each reason }<br>The strength of the reasons for a "no" answer could be rated from moderate to high based on the extensive preparations of the Russian defenses and the unpredictability of war. The strength of the reasons for a "yes" answer could be rated as moderate, given the substantial assistance Ukraine has received from Western allies and their demonstrated resilience and strategy. However, the inherent unpredictability of armed conflict makes forecasting the result with high confidence challenging.<br><br>{ Insert your aggregated considerations }<br>Considering the mix of reported extensive Russian fortifications and the apparent determination and improvements in the Ukrainian military capability, the outcome of the specific goal of retaking Polohy by October 1, 2023, is highly uncertain. While the improvements to Ukraine's military might indicate potential success, well-established defenses and the potential for Russian counteractions incline towards caution in predicting a swift Ukrainian victory in this specific area. Furthermore, the chaotic nature of war and the limited information available create substantial uncertainty.<br><br>{ Insert your answer }<br>Considering all factors and the inherent unpredictability of the situation, my forecast would be moderately uncertain but somewhat leaning towards a positive outcome for the Ukrainian counteroffensive based on their demonstrated determination, Western support, and strategic planning.

The defensive system, constructed in anticipation of Kyiv's offensive, features three lines of fortifications, including obstacle belts, dragons' teeth, and wire track entanglements. British intelligence officials describe the Russian efforts as extensive and formidable. Ukrainian troops, while preparing for the counter-offensive, have expressed admiration for the enemy's construction of trenches.

Wait for the Heavy Brigades (published on 2023-06-11)<br>Summary: The social media channels are buzzing with footage of tanks and explosions in Southern and Eastern Ukraine, indicating the start of Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive. However, the main attack has not yet begun, as large armored formations have not joined the assault. The Ukrainian army is estimated to have put together seven to 12 armored brigades, some equipped with Western-provided kit. The offensive aims to liberate Crimea by the end of August, with the hope of receiving additional support from the West. The Russian side has fortified parts of Ukraine in anticipation of the counteroffensive. The Ukrainian army is still probing and reinforcing tactical successes, possibly to confuse the Russians about the location of the main attack. The Ukrainian General Staff has done a superb job protecting information to prevent the Russians from knowing what's happening. The destruction of a single tank was recovered and repaired, showcasing the army's resilience. The uncertainty in Russian minds may have been one reason for their sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam. The flooding may have delayed UAF offensive operations in that area for a time, but the effect is likely to be short-lived.

The UK Ministry of Defence reported significant operations in eastern and southern Ukraine, with Russian defences breached in some areas. The counteroffensive is expected to be a long and bloody process, with Ukraine likely to take casualties.

The 68th brigade reported the liberation of Blahodatne, a village in Donetsk province, 10km inside Russian-occupied territory. Russian military bloggers suggested the raid had gone deeper, taking other nearby villages. Progress was also made near Bakhmut, with Ukrainians advancing to encircle the devastated town.

The success of the offensive will influence future support for Ukraine and discussions about its future. President Zelensky has not publicly defined success, but privately, U.S. and European officials acknowledge that pushing all Russian forces out of Ukraine is unlikely. Success is seen as retaking and holding key territory and dealing a blow to the Russian military. The Ukrainian army has outperformed Russia but has struggled to dislodge them in recent months. The success of the counteroffensive is uncertain, but it could secure additional military aid and build support for a long-term security guarantee for Ukraine.<br><br>[6] Ukraine counter-offensive actions have begun, Zelensky says (published on 2023-06-10)<br>Summary: Ukraine's President Zelensky confirmed the start of the long-awaited counter-offensive against Russia, with Ukrainian troops reportedly advancing near Bakhmut and Zaporizhzhia. However, assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with conflicting narratives from both sides. Russian President Putin claimed that Ukrainian advances had failed with heavy casualties. Zelensky, after talks with Canadian PM Trudeau, described Putin's words as "interesting" and stated that Ukraine's military commanders were in a positive mood. The Ukrainian spring counteroffensive seems imminent, with preparations and reactions from both sides. Whether Ukraine will retake Polohy by October 1, 2023, remains uncertain.<br><br>[7] Ukraine’s Offensive Operations: Shifting the Offense-Defense Balance (published on 2023-06-09)<br>Summary: Ukraine's offensive capabilities may allow for a successful retaking of Polohy. The Russian military's defensive fortifications, weakened ground forces, and expansive front line may present opportunities for Ukraine to exploit. Additionally, Ukraine's innovative use of technology, force employment, and strong will to fight could further shift the advantage to the offense. However, the success of the offensive will depend on the effective integration of these factors and the support of Western aid. Therefore, it is plausible that Ukraine could retake Polohy by the 1st of October, 2023, as part of its broader counteroffensive strategy.<br><br>[8] Ukraine's counter-offensive against Russia under way (published on 2023-06-09)<br>Summary: Ukraine's long-anticipated counter-offensive against Russia appears to be underway, with Ukrainian forces conducting "shaping operations" and moving forward across open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine. The destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and subsequent flooding has affected the military operations, and heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front. The Ukrainian army's success in retaking Polohy by the 1st of October, 2023, will depend on their ability to punch through Russian lines and the effectiveness of their military operations. Given the complex operational picture and the time restraints, it is uncertain whether they will achieve this goal.<br><br>[9] Opinion | The Ukrainian offensive is beginning. David Petraeus is optimistic. (published on 2023-06-09)<br>Summary: David Petraeus, a respected general, believes that the Ukrainian counteroffensive will achieve significant breakthroughs, despite the challenging military task. The Ukrainian forces, trained by NATO and armed with advanced equipment, are expected to advance to the Sea of Azov. However, they lack air superiority and will face tough fighting. The flooding of the Kakhovka Dam is not expected to significantly affect the offensive. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014, and even if the counteroffensive is successful, it may continue beyond 2023. The Ukrainian military has undergone significant transformation, while the Russian military remains mired in a Soviet-era mindset.

Considering the military situation, strategic significance, and infrastructure in Polohy, coupled with the current military preparations and operations, to what likelihood does Ukraine have in regaining control over the town of Polohy, as evidenced by Ukrainian control or claimed counteroffensives at the Polohy Train Station and House of Culture "Miner" reflected on the ISW Ukraine Interactive War Map, on or before October 1st, 2023?<br><br>2. Reasons why the answer might be no:<br>- Extensive and formidable Russian fortifications: The Russians have established a robust defensive network that could impede Ukrainian advances (Strong reason).<br>- Mixed results of the Ukrainian counter-offensive: Current reports suggest that results have been varied, not indicating a decisive edge that could lead to a swift retake of Polohy (Moderate to strong reason).<br>- Challenge in piercing through Russian lines: The success in breaching Russian defenses and making headway towards Polohy is uncertain (strong reason).<br>- Limited Ukrainian air superiority: Without control of the skies, sustained forward momentum and consolidating gains could be more challenging for Ukraine (Moderate to strong reason).<br>- Geopolitical and operational unpredictability: Ongoing developments could alter the battlefield scenario unpredictably (Moderate reason).<br><br>3. Reasons why the answer might be yes:<br>- Strategic importance of Polohy: As Polohy is relatively close to the frontline and a possible primary direction of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, it may receive concentrated efforts (Strong reason).<br>- Improvements in Ukrainian capabilities: The Ukrainian army has reportedly formed new armored brigades and received Western tanks and AFVs, bolstering their offensive capability (Strong reason).<br>- Positive recent developments: There are reports of Ukrainian forces making progress in several areas, indicating a potentially favorable momentum (Moderate to strong reason).<br>- History of Ukrainian advancements: Ukraine has previously illustrated the capability to regain territory and could replicate such successes (Moderate reason).<br>- Russian weaknesses: The stretched-thin Russian forces and defensive fortifications could be exploitable weak points for the Ukrainian counteroffensive (Moderate to strong reason).<br><br>4. Aggregating considerations, the dynamic situation on the battlefield, and the strategic importance of Polohy to the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive, as well as the recent bolstering of Ukrainian forces, suggest a nuanced outlook. Holistically, the Ukrainian intent and recent successes provide optimism, yet formidable Russian defenses and underlying battlefield uncertainties highlight significant challenges ahead.<br><br>5. Initial probability: There is a reasonably balanced case for both possible outcomes, but the strength of the Russian defenses may initially tilt the probability slightly against the success of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in retaking Polohy by the specified date.<br><br>6. Adjusting the probability, it is crucial to consider the unknowns that can drastically sway the equation, such as the possible escalations in conflict, changes in international support levels, or unanticipated military breakthroughs. The recent signs of progress by the Ukrainian forces could slightly raise optimism, but the success of such a military endeavor is never guaranteed.<br><br>7.

The counteroffensive is reportedly imminent or may have already begun, and despite the strong Russian fortification efforts in the region, the success of the Ukrainian military action is still uncertain.<br><br>2. ***Decision Tree Outline:***<br><br>- Ukrainian Counteroffensive<br>  - **Yes Outcome:**<br>    - Sufficient military strength and tactics overcome Russian defenses<br>    - Adequate Western assistance in terms of weaponry and intelligence<br>    - Favorable operational conditions (weather, terrain, logistics)<br>    - High morale and effective command structure<br>    - Potential Russian strategic blunders or misallocation of resources<br>  - **No Outcome:**<br>    - Russian defenses hold firm against the Ukrainian assault<br>    - Insufficient logistical support or military capabilities on Ukraine’s part<br>    - Political or diplomatic developments leading to ceasefires or halts<br>    - Unpredictable operational setbacks for Ukraine (weather, counterattacks)<br>    - Resilience and tactical superiority of Russian forces in the region<br><br>3. ***Branch Probability Analysis:***<br><br>- Based on the provided information, assessing the strength of the Russian fortifications and the fact that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has not yet been fully launched, it is difficult to precisely predict the success of Ukraine’s efforts. Given the element of unknown variables, such as the actual progress of current operations and the full extent of Western military support, assigning exact probabilities is challenging. Tentatively, one might weigh the prospects of overcoming Russian defenses as less probable than maintaining the status quo, at least until more definitive information emerges.<br><br>4. ***Discussion on Wildcards:***<br><br>Potential game-changers could include a significant increase in Western military aid, such as the delivery of advanced weaponry and intelligence support that could enhance the offensive capability of Ukraine. Escalation or de-escalation of NATO-Russia tensions and internal political shifts within Russia leading to changes in military focus or strategy could also heavily influence the outcome. Natural events or infrastructure disruptions (like the mentioned dam sabotage) that impact either side's ability to wage or sustain operations would as well be wildcards.<br><br>5. ***Initial Probability (Prediction):***<br><br>Given the lack of clear indications of Ukraine's success in their current operations, the strength of Russia's fortifications, and the unpredictability of war, a conservative initial estimation would likely lean towards the lower end of the probability scale for Ukraine retaking Polohy by the 1st of October 2023.<br><br>6. ***Probability Adjustment Considerations:***<br><br>- A calculated probability might be excessively confident if it significantly favors a "Yes" outcome, given the formidable Russian defenses.<br>- Possible intelligence breakthroughs, sabotage operations, or underestimation of Ukrainian capabilities could affect the forecast in favor of Ukraine.<br>- Intuition might suggest that Ukraine, with Western support building up, could create an upset even against well-prepared defenses.<br><br>7. ***Final Answer:***<br><br>Given the information provided and understanding of the dynamics of military conflict, as well as considering potential external factors and wildcards, the final estimated probability of Ukraine retaking Polohy by the 1st of October 2023 is:<br><br>*0.35*</div></td>
