In preparation for this counter offensive, the Ukrainian army allegedly has formed several new battalions, several of them with western tanks and AFVs. Accordingly, the Russian side has reacted to this threat by building defensive fortifications in territories it controls. The counteroffensive itself seems to be quite imminent or might have already even have begun.
As the city of Polohy is about 20 km from the frontline and in the direction towards which it is "most obvious" the counteroffensive would take place towards it is apparent to ask - will the Ukrainian army manage to retake Polohy with this summer offensive?</p>

While Russia’s defensive fortifications are impressive in their size and scale—at least in some respects—they are likely insufficient to prevent Ukrainian forces from breaking through Russian lines and retaking territory illegally seized by Russia. In short, Russian defensive actions do not guarantee that the defense has the advantage. Several steps could shift the advantage to the offense.

Weakness of Defensive Forces

Fortifications are only as good as the forces defending them. In the 1930s, France constructed the Maginot Line, which included concrete fortifications, machine guns, anti-tank emplacements, and even underground railways. The Maginot Line had state-of-the-art living conditions for specialist units of infantry, artillery, and engineers—even including air conditioning. But the French military was relatively weak. It had a debilitated air force and a large army that was unprepared for offensive operations, though it had a reasonably strong navy.[19] Germany exploited these French weaknesses during its invasion of France in 1940.

The Russian military—especially the army—has been battered over the past year. Following its February 2022 invasion, Russia failed to achieve many of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor combined arms operations; ineffective joint operations, such as close air support to Russian ground forces; problematic intelligence, including faulty Federal Security Service planning and analysis; significant logistical problems; and low morale. These factors were vital for Ukraine’s lightning offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in 2022, where Ukrainian forces achieved operational surprise, broke through Russian lines, and captured a key logistical hub to trigger a collapse among Russian ground forces and the liberation of more than 12,000 square kilometers of territory.[20]

The deployment of Wagner Group private military contractors to the front lines in eastern Ukraine in 2023 has further highlighted the poor performance of Russian ground forces, as well as the political risks of a full-scale Russian mobilization. Consequently, a partially bruised and demoralized Russian army sits behind the extensive fortifications, which may present opportunities for Ukraine.

Furthermore, the Russian military likely does not have enough high-quality forces to defend all parts of the line. The 70 combat regiments and brigades Russia has in Ukraine will likely not be sufficient to form a large mobile reserve, even if Russia commands enough soldiers to adequately staff its fortifications.[21] The lack of a strong mobile reserve means that Russia will be hard-pressed to surge forces to fill gaps in its lines, station forces in second-echelon defensive positions, and conduct counterattacks according to its defensive doctrine.[22]

Expansive Front Line

Ukraine can use the extensive front line to its advantage. Territory can be important, particularly the size of a front and the territory an attacker is attempting to seize. While the Maginot Line in France covered approximately 450 kilometers, it did not cover every inch of French territory or key parts of France’s border with Belgium and Luxembourg. Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium in May 1940. Later that month, German forces penetrated the Maginot Line at a weak part along the Belgian frontier, where France’s defenses had few forces that were of relatively low quality. On May 15, 1940, Heinz Guderian’s XIX Panzer Corps broke through the French line and headed west into open country, sealing France’s fate.[23]

One historical lesson for Ukraine and its Western supporters is to continue assessing weak spots in the Russian lines where there are opportunities for penetration, where Russian defenses are poorly constructed or of insufficient depth, and where Russian forces are understaffed or of particularly poor quality.[24] Ukrainian forces know this terrain well, since it is land many of their soldiers grew up on.

The formidable appearance of Russia’s defensive fortifications may also obscure as much as it reveals. Russia has used contractors to dig trenches, many of whom likely lack significant military engineering experience.[25] There have also been reports of Russian mistreatment of these contractors.[26] Lack of expertise or low morale could lead to the fortifications being less effective than they appear in satellite imagery.

Variation in the quality of Russia’s dragon’s teeth is notable, despite the media attention they have generated as a symbol of Russia’s defenses in Ukraine. These obstacles are most effective when connected to one another by concrete linkages underground and partially buried. Some images appear to show dragon’s teeth without underground connections. Other images appear to show dragon’s teeth sitting on top of the earth rather than partially under it. One image posted on several Russian websites also appears to show that some of the dragon’s teeth used by Russia are not entirely made of concrete and are already suffering environmental damage in Ukraine.[27] It is impossible to draw sweeping conclusions about the overall quality of Russia’s defenses from these images, but they are enough to suggest that there are variations in the quality of defenses across the line that can be exploited by Ukraine with good intelligence.

The Ukrainian front covers roughly 1,000 kilometers—more than double the size of the Maginot Line—as it zigzags from the grassy slopes of the northeast, hugs the Dnipro River, and extends to the Black Sea.[28] This large front is likely a major vulnerability for the Russians. As one assessment of the offense-defense balance concludes, “If the attacker is faced with a defender who is protecting a narrow front, the probability that the blitzkrieg will succeed is much less than if the attacker can strike at a defender deployed across a broad front.”[29] This challenge is often called the force-to-space ratio.[30] Russia likely lacks the force-to-space ratio to defend such an expansive territory.

The May 2023 clashes between Russian security forces and fighters in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, near the Ukrainian border, likely worsened Russia’s deployment problems by forcing the Russian military to move troops to its internationally recognized border with Ukraine.[31] These types of attacks could increase Russia’s force-to-space ratio problems by thinning out its defensive positions in some areas.

Technology and Military Innovation

Technology can impact the offense-defense balance. The offense generally requires mobility.[32] The attacker must first achieve a breakthrough by defeating or destroying a section of the defender’s front, and then it must exploit this breakthrough to advance into the defender’s rear.[33] As noted earlier in this analysis, advances in military mobility have sometimes shifted the balance in favor of the offense.[34]

The Ukrainian military has thus far been innovative in its development and use of technology.[35] Military innovation involves a change in the conduct of warfare intended to improve the ability of a military to generate combat power. A change in the conduct of warfare does not necessarily require a change in military doctrine, but it does involve change at the operational level of war.[36]

One example of Ukrainian innovation has been the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in combined arms warfare, which includes the blending of infantry, direct and indirect fire, aviation, and other joint capabilities to achieve political and military objectives.[37] Ukraine has utilized UASs to conduct several types of missions as part of combined arms warfare, such as target identification for artillery, strike, battlefield damage assessment, and information operations.[38]

The challenge for Ukraine will be to innovatively utilize technology and adapt its conduct of warfare in ways that maximize mobility to exploit Russian vulnerabilities. For example, Ukrainian forces could use a combination of advanced technology and UASs or loitering munitions—including those supplied by the West—to conduct UAS “swarms” against Russian defensive positions. As interviews with Ukrainian military officials indicate, Ukraine is investing significant time and resources into innovations such as swarming tactics designed to maximize target saturation and overwhelm Russian defenses.[39] UASs could also be employed to probe for gaps in Russian lines, locate Russian reserves or artillery systems, or provide artillery-like effects in support of high-mobility units exploiting a breakthrough.

An important technological obstacle to Ukraine’s efforts is Russia’s electronic warfare capabilities. Russia has effectively used electronic warfare to combat Ukrainian UASs.[40] The ability of the Ukrainian military to find and destroy Russian electronic warfare systems, which are now organic to units at multiple levels, will be a key enabler of offensive success.

Strategy, Force Employment, Will to Fight, and Other Intangibles

Attackers can make up for a tough defense with clever strategies, effective force employment, leadership, nationalism, will to fight, combat motivation, morale, and other factors. Force employment, for example, includes how militaries use force on the battlefield—a combination of cover, concealment, dispersion, suppression, small-unit independent maneuver, and combined arms operations.[41] Some also call this “military skill,” which describes a country’s ability to effectively employ military technology, including designing military strategy and assessing adversaries’ forces and strategy.[42]

Will to fight and nationalism can influence the offense-defense balance, and neither have been in short supply among Ukrainians. To the extent that soldiers are motivated by nationalism, they frequently become willing to fight harder for territory that they understand to be part of their national homeland.[43] The Ukrainian military and civilians have shown an extraordinary will to fight since the start of the war.

The reverse is also true: soldiers who are not imbued with a nationalist consciousness may be less willing to fight for territory. Confederate soldiers deserted the Army of Northern Virginia at the Potomac in 1862 because “they felt that they were fighting to defend Virginia’s soil, not to invade the North.”[44] In addition, Hitler was unwilling to risk imposing full war mobilization on Germany until the failure of Operation Barbarossa opened the possibility that Germany’s own homeland security might be threatened.[45]

Despite President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that Ukraine is part of the Russian empire, it is unclear how much this argument has convinced Russian soldiers and contractors. Recent research on absent without leave (AWOL) cases in Russian military courts suggests that an increasing number of Russian military personnel are not convinced. AWOL cases in the first four months of 2023 already surpassed the total number of cases in 2022.[46] It is impossible to say definitively that the rise indicates that Russians in Ukraine have a low will to fight, but it is hardly an indicator of a strongly motivated military.

A clever strategy is also important. Between 1919 and 1945, an evolving offensive doctrine (blitzkrieg) and motorized armor shifted the advantage to the offense and overrode machine guns, trenches, railroads, and barbed wire.[47] As B.H. Liddell Hart explained in analyzing German General Heinz Guderian’s blitzkrieg into France in May 1940:

"It is clear that Guderian and his tankmen pulled the German Army along after them, and thereby produced the most sweeping victory in modern history.

The issue turned on the time factor at stage after stage. French countermovements were repeatedly thrown out of gear because their timing was too slow to catch up with changing situations, and that was due to the fact that the German van kept on moving faster than the German high command had contemplated."[48]

In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel Defense Forces heavily relied on armor and air forces to destroy significant components of the Egyptian and Syrian air forces. Within three days, the Israelis captured the Gaza Strip and all of the Sinai Peninsula up to the east bank of the Suez Canal. Israeli forces then drove Jordanian troops out of East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank and seized the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel developed an effective blitzkrieg strategy that relied on armor to inflict a decisive defeat against its Arab adversaries. As Moshe Dayan explained to Israel’s Ministerial Defense Committee before the war, “If we opened the attack and effected an armored breakthrough into Sinai, the enemy would be forced to fight according to the moves we made.”[49]

For Ukraine today, maneuver warfare demands a flexible command structure with soldiers capable of exercising initiative in combat situations. It is not based on a rigid plan that commanders need to follow closely.[50] Ukrainian soldiers at the platoon, company, and battalion levels have already shown a proclivity to taking the initiative. In World War II, the German military developed a doctrine of Auftragstaktik, which dictated that commanders be given a battlefield objective rather than lengthy orders that micromanaged how they do it.[51] This doctrine helped enable implementation of blitzkrieg, which requires lower-level commanders to act quickly and decisively in order to exploit breakthroughs and maintain the momentum required to avoid enemy counterattack.

A clever Ukrainian strategy that penetrates Russian lines could have significant follow-on effects. For example, a major breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia could severely threaten the viability of Russia’s land bridge linking Russia’s Rostov region with Crimea. Even a breakthrough in the less-densely defended Luhansk Oblast could provide significant benefits by proving that Western support for Ukraine continues to bear fruit, removing Russian units from the battlefield, and sowing further dissent within Russia itself.

Next Steps

The next phase of the war will hinge, in part, on the ability of Ukrainian forces to retake territory by moving from attrition to maneuver warfare and to shift the offense-defense balance in favor of the offense. As Napoleon wrote, “The strength of an army, like power in mechanics, is estimated by multiplying the mass by the velocity.”[52] A Ukrainian maneuver strategy places a premium on the second factor—velocity. Russian forces have attempted to shift the advantage to the defense and retain the territory they have conquered in Ukraine by constructing a formidable system of fortifications. But Russia faces several challenges in holding this territory, including weak ground forces that have not performed well on the battlefield, the need to defend a massive amount of territory, and variable construction of the fortifications.

This war is far from over. Western aid—including weapons systems, technology, training, intelligence, and financial support—will be critical over the long run to help Ukraine retake its territory and prevent Russia from invading again in the foreseeable future. The future trajectory of the war will also depend on whether Ukraine can exploit Russian vulnerabilities and effectively integrate technology, a clever strategy, force employment, nationalism, and other factors to turn the tide.

Email Icon Save Layered Russian defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines Advancing Ukrainian troops must break through an elaborate network of Russian defences running hundreds of miles across the country that were built in anticipation of Kyiv’s offensive. With the initial assaults now underway, new satellite imagery provided to The Telegraph by Maxar Technologies has revealed the array of minefields, anti-tank ditches, and trenches lying ahead of the Ukrainian troops attempting to push south. The defences, according to a Ukrainian intelligence officer, are constructed in a “three-line system”, with varying levels of fortifications, the depths of which can exceed around 19 miles on some axes. “They have unbelievable trenches and unbelievable fortifications, it will be hard to break their lines of defence” Serhii, a commander in Ukraine’s National Guards, told The Telegraph. “There are also minefields and they have good artillery - more than us unfortunately.” These layered defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines separating Ukrainian forces from the Russian occupiers. For more than six months, Ukraine has been preparing 12 new offensive brigades, including nine armed and trained by Nato nations, for the task at hand. This time has given Russia ample time to build fortifications in the areas most likely expected to be targeted by Kyiv - occupied Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s south and the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east. One of the new satellite images shows trenches carefully carved into agricultural land outside the town of Mykhailivka, around 40 miles west of Tokmak, where Ukrainian forces are reportedly making a push. Russia’s fortifications in southern Ukraine The carefully-constructed ditches stretch for miles across a series of farmers’ fields, serving as a rear defensive position on the lands occupied by Moscow’s forces. In a sign of Russian caution, the array of trenches seen in the images are positioned almost 19 miles behind the current front lines. Other satellite images show deep trenches just in front of a tree line, which is then used to disguise artillery positions that can strike approaching forces. Ukrainian soldiers prepare for battle on the front line south of Bakhmut Credit : Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Closer to the front, Moscow’s forces have deployed triangular concrete blocks known as “dragons’ teeth” in a bid to slow Ukrainian armour in any attempted push south. One satellite image taken in March shows hundreds of the anti-tank structures arranged in rows, as well as personnel trenches, just east of Vaylivka, a city which sits on a road junction heading towards occupied Melitopol. And ahead of those, while not visible to the satellite, would likely be a vast network of minefields aimed at stopping any initial drive south by Ukrainian troops. The layered defensive system Ukrainian troops must break through “The first line, along the line of contact, comprises the fighting positions made by the infantry,” according to a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute. “The second constitutes properly made trenches as compared with fox holes in the first – and concrete firing posts where possible. “Several obstacle belts are laid in front of these positions, usually formed with a 4m deep and 6m wide anti-tank ditch, dragons’ teeth and wire track entanglements. “The depth of defence is usually 5km from the first, and each belt of physical defences tends to span between 700m and a kilometre, so that the entire obstacle series is covered by fire. “The third line usually comprises full-back fighting positions and concealed areas for reserves, with positions dug for vehicles.” Ukrainian soldiers wade through floodwater in Afanasiyivka following the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam this week Credit : OLEKSII FILIPPOV/AFP/Getty Images British intelligence officials have described the Russian efforts to fortify their positions as “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world”. Recent analysis of these positions suggest they could stretch across the entire front line from occupied Crimea to the Donbas. Ukrainian troops have even grown to admire their enemy’s ability to construct trenches, an admission that the counter-offensive is unlikely to be as easy as some observers expect. “We should learn from our enemy on how they construct their trenches, because they are so excellent at that,” Serhii, the intelligence officer, said. “They use specialised vehicles, not only hands.” License this content Advertisement More stories</div></td>

There are statements everywhere that Kyiv’s long-expected counteroffensive is underway, which is causing some excitement and trepidation. The offensive is incredibly important for Ukraine’s future.

But when assessing what’s actually happening, it’s useful to understand some key facts. There is a big difference between starting an offensive, and the main attack or main effort of the operation. The offensive has clearly started, but not I think the main attack.

When we see large, armored formations join the assault, then I think we’ll know the main attack has really begun. To date, I don’t think we’ve witnessed this concentration of several hundred tanks and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) in the attack.

A Ukrainian tank battalion normally has 31 tanks. An armored infantry battalion would have about the same number. Add in armored vehicles carrying engineers, air defense, logistics, and so on. An armored brigade would likely have three tank battalions and one or two mechanized infantry battalions. In total, then, an armored brigade is going to have 250-plus armored vehicles of different types.

I estimate that the Ukrainians have put together anywhere from seven to 12 armored brigades. Some may have only Ukrainian or captured Russian equipment, and others will have a mix of Western-provided kit.

When we see two or three of those brigades (around 500-750 armored vehicles) focused on a narrow front, it will then be possible to say that the main attack has probably started and where it’s happening. But even then, be careful. The Ukrainian General Staff will want to keep the Russians guessing about the location of the main attack for as long as possible, and they won’t be too bothered (and will probably welcome) Twitter getting it wrong.

How Russia has fortified parts of Ukraine ahead of a possible counteroffensive Defensive fortifications have sprung up along, behind and sometimes far removed from the front lines.

If the West provides everything the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) need, especially long-range precision weapons, then I still anticipate that Ukraine can liberate Crimea, the decisive terrain of this war, by the end of this summer, that is to say, by the end of August. This is one of the aims of the offensive, I believe. At that point, the UAF’s long-range precision weapons could reach Sevastopol, Saky, Dzankoy, and other key Crimean targets, and that would allow them to make the peninsula untenable for Russian forces. That’s why the UK’s delivery of Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles with a range of 155-plus miles, was such an important contribution.

I hope the Biden Administration will finally relent and give short-range (up to 300km or 186 miles) ground-to-ground ATACMS ballistic missiles to Ukraine. That would mark a decisive contribution to what Ukrainian forces can achieve on the ground by giving the offensive an enormous boost.

Some have dated the start of this campaign to June 4, two days before Russia’s sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnipro River on June 6. That was likely the moment when General Valerii Zaluzhny, the UAF commander-in-chief, decided — in my view — that his three preconditions had been met and that he could therefore give the green light. He would have asked:

Is there enough combat power (armored brigades with tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, engineers, artillery, air defense and logistics) to be able to penetrate the Russian linear defenses and achieve their assigned tasks, which probably includes cutting the “land bridge” from Russia to Crimea, and also securing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?;

Have Russian defenses and logistics been sufficiently degraded; has the Russian rear area and transportation network been adequately disrupted; and are the Russian leadership confused enough as to the aim and timings of the UAF offensive?; and

Is the ground dry enough to support the movement of hundreds of heavy, tracked, armored vehicles?

Lined up in defensive positions before the UAF assault units are the Russians, sitting behind hundreds of miles of trenches with bunkers, minefields, anti-tank ditches, and “Dragons Teeth” obstacle belts. But these defenses are only as good as the soldiers occupying them and covering those obstacles. I’m not impressed with the fighting capabilities of the Russians in most places, and the vicious in-fighting we see between the various Russian leaders, (e.g., warlords like Prigozhin and Kadyrov) highlights the lack of cohesion on the Russian side. I imagine the UAF will exploit this.

How Russia has fortified parts of Ukraine ahead of a possible counteroffensive Russian defensive fortifications have sprung up along, behind and sometimes far removed from the front lines.

So far, it seems that the Ukrainians are still probing, pressing, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit, reinforcing local tactical success where they find or create it. That's one of the benefits of their adoption of Western-style tactical command and control where lower-level leaders can make decisions on their own. And some of what we are seeing is intended, perhaps, to confuse the Russians as to where the main attack will eventually be delivered. To show a Leopard on the battlefield at such an early stage was probably, in my view, intended to draw a lot of attention to that area, perhaps as a decoy. I cannot know that, but it's something I would have done, given all the attention in the media about these excellent tanks.

As always, those taking part in the fighting face not only enemy deception but also the sheer confusion of combat. The fog of war really does affect commanders in the field. I always had great difficulty visualizing and understanding what was going on during a fight — as a brigade commander and corps chief of operations in Iraq, and later as Director of Operations in Kandahar, Afghanistan — even though we had the latest command and control systems. A commander is still dependent on the reports from forward commanders actually engaged at the battle area’s forward edge. Drones help give some overview, but it's still a challenge. That's why it is essential to trust subordinate commanders to understand the overall plan and continue making good decisions in the heat of battle.

Even so, there are going to be losses. The destruction of a single Leopard caused a lot of excitement on Twitter, but it was actually recovered from the battlefield so that it could be repaired and put back in the fight. That's impressive. It's what we practice in the US Army, and it’s worth noting the UAF’s achievement in doing the same.

There is much uncertainty, but of one thing we can be sure — the Ukrainian General Staff has done a superb job protecting information in order to prevent the Russians from knowing what's happening and enabling them to prepare for the attack.

The uncertainty in Russian minds may have been one reason for their sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam. Quite apart from its horrific humanitarian and ecological consequences, the flooding of low ground and widening of the Dnipro may have delayed UAF offensive operations in that area for a time. But there are expert voices saying the floodwaters will subside within the next five to seven days, and the ground will rapidly begin to dry in the summer heat. So the likely intended effect hoped for by the Russian side — of making crossings of the Dnipro harder — is probably going to be relatively short-lived.

Meanwhile, I have no trust whatsoever about any report from the Russian side on the dam’s demolition or about anything happening on the line of contact. The Ukrainians, of course, are very disciplined in protecting information and are also very good at controlling the narrative. We’ll know more soon.

So what does Ukraine need as it engages in this great national effort? It needs advocates, and it badly needs ATACMS.

"Counter-offensive and defensive actions are taking place," he said.

But he added that he would not talk in detail about which stage or state the counter-offensive was in.

The comments come after an escalation of fighting in the south and east of Ukraine and speculation about progress of the widely anticipated push.

Ukrainian troops are reported to have advanced in the east near Bakhmut and in the south near Zaporizhzhia, and have carried out long-range strikes on Russian targets.

But assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with the two warring sides presenting contrasting narratives: Ukraine claiming progress and Russia that it is fighting off attacks.

Meanwhile in Russia's Kaluga region - which borders the southern districts around Moscow - governor Vladislav Shapsha said on Telegram that a drone crashed near the village of Strelkovk early on Sunday. The BBC has not independently verified the report.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a video interview published Friday that Ukrainian forces had certainly begun their offensive but that attempted advances had failed with heavy casualties.

Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday after talks with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Mr Zelensky described the Russian leader's words as "interesting".

Shrugging his shoulders, raising his eyebrows and pretending not to know who Mr Putin was, Mr Zelensky said it was important that Russia felt "they do not have long left".

The Ukrainian leader made the comment on Saturday at a news conference in Kyiv, while standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He was responding to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement a day earlier that Ukraine’s counteroffensive had started and that Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses”.

Zelenskyy said that “counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.”

“I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders.

“Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.”

Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was under way, though some Western analysts have said fiercer fighting and reported use of reserve troops suggests it was.

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy provided few details while urging troops to keep fighting.

“Thank you to all those who hold their positions and those who advance,” he said, citing the eastern and southern fronts, where fighting is heaviest.

Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had repelled enemy attacks around Bakhmut and Marinka, sites of heavy clashes in the east. Russian forces, it said, “continue to suffer heavy losses which they are trying to conceal”.

Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar made it plain on Telegram that the military would issue no statements until battlefield positions became clear.

“Ask yourself this… am I prepared to receive information about the liberation of this or that town not when our troops enter it, but once they establish a stronghold?” she wrote.

Ukraine has said for months it plans to conduct a significant counteroffensive to recapture land occupied by Russia in the south and east. But it is enforcing strict operational silence for now and has denied it has begun the main operation.

With scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been difficult to assess the state of the fighting.

‘Significant’ operations

The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said Ukraine had conducted “significant” operations in several eastern and southern parts in the last 48 hours, with Russian defences breached in places.

“In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower,” it said, also characterising the Russian military’s performance as mixed.

“Some [Russian] units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields,” it said.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive is expected to use thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West but Russia has built huge fortifications in occupied territory to prepare, while Kyiv also lacks air supremacy.

Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert at the University of Bath in the UK, told Al Jazeera that the counteroffensive was likely to be a “long game” and that its initial operations would “probably be the most bloody part for the Ukrainians”.

“It’s highly unlikely that we’re going to see a rapid breakthrough like we saw in Kharkiv back in September, for example, where the Ukrainians were able to, with the help of allied intelligence, identify places where there were just exhausted and ruined Russian units and drove essentially past them and kept going. It’s not going to be like that,” he said.

“The Russians have had months to prepare significant offences and these are … defensive positions with trenches, bunkers, minefields, in particular, which are designed to channel attackers into killing zones.”

The Ukrainians were likely to take “a lot of casualties” while going on the attack.

“It’s much easier to defend: You know the ground, you know what the plan is, you know ‘I’m going to hold this position until they get to here and then I’m going to fall back to here, and then that other position is going to support me’,” Bury said.

“It’s significantly easier for the defenders as the Ukrainians found out when they were defending last year. It’s much more difficult for the attackers,” he added. “Yes, you have some intelligence preparation but you don’t know exactly where everything is; it’s all new to you, the terrain and you’re being fired on etc as you try to advance; so it’s much more difficult for them.”

The south is seen as a key strategic priority for a Ukrainian push that could aim to recapture Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and cut the Russian land bridge to the occupied Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, dividing Russian forces.

The fighting there has drawn renewed attention following the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam along the Dnipro River on Tuesday.

The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparked fears of humanitarian and environmental disasters. Ukraine says Russia blew up the dam. Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing on it.

Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since the dam’s breach, offered up monetary, military and moral support.

He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375m) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6bn) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5m) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response.

Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war”, but he did not blame Moscow directly.

In other developments, the UK government also said it will give 16 million pounds ($20m) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding.

Most of the money is being channelled through international organisations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations. The UK is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he wanted to continue speaking with Putin and plans to do so again “soon”.

Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops.

Ukraine live briefing: Zelensky claims ‘step-by-step’ progress in counteroffensive; Putin says Kyiv hasn’t achieved its goals Ukrainian soldiers in a combat operation in the country's east on Thursday. (Roman Chop/AP) Listen 8 min Share Add to your saved stories Save Ukrainian officials have reported fierce fighting on the front lines after their military launched its long-anticipated counteroffensive. President Volodymyr Zelensky said that “very tough battles” were raging in the eastern Donetsk region and that Ukrainian forces were seeing “step-by-step” results. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday offered his first remarks acknowledging the counteroffensive, telling reporters that the Kremlin could say with “absolute certainty” that the campaign had begun but that Ukraine had not achieved its goals. Ukraine has not made an official announcement on the counteroffensive — and has previously cautioned that no single action would mark the start of the campaign. However, Ukrainian troops intensified strikes in the southeast this week, according to four service members, The Washington Post reported. The offensive is expected to unfold over months and serve as a test of months-long efforts by the United States and Ukraine’s other Western backers to train its forces and equip them with increasingly sophisticated weapons. Advertisement Here’s the latest on the war and its ripple effects across the globe. Key developments Intense fighting has been reported in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, long seen as the likely focal point for Ukraine’s counterattack. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Friday that Russia is “conducting defensive operations” in the area. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, long seen as the likely focal point for Ukraine’s counterattack. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Friday that Russia is “conducting defensive operations” in the area. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, said on Telegram that an attack on a hospital in Huliapole, a town near the region’s front line, killed two staff members. If Ukraine retakes Zaporizhzhia, it could disrupt critical Russian supply lines by cutting off the land route connecting Russian-occupied Crimea to the Russian mainland.

Putin pointed to the use of “strategic reserves” as evidence that the counteroffensive had begun. “On none of the sectors of the front line did the Ukrainian troops achieve the tasks assigned to them,” he said at a meeting of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Sochi, Russia. Putin said Ukraine was suffering heavy losses but that it still retained “offensive potential.”

A senior Western intelligence official told The Post that , for now, Ukraine appeared to be holding back its most significant firepower, noting that the larger blow “hasn’t landed yet.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.

Ukraine’s military is armed with a potent U.S. arsenal. Washington has Washington has committed 90 Stryker personnel carriers and more than 100 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The Strykers and Bradleys are generally faster, more advanced and better protected than the aging Soviet and Russian vehicles that the Ukrainians operate, but they are more technically challenging to maintain in the field. The United States has also pledged 31 Abrams tanks, but they will not be ready until September at the earliest.

The situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains “precarious,” according to Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. There have been concerns over safety at the Russian-occupied plant after the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam reduced water levels in the reservoir used to supply cooling water to the plant. For now, the plant is continuing to pump cooling water from the reservoir, but it is not clear when and at what level the reservoir will stabilize, Grossi said.

While assessments of the dam collapse were still underway, the senior Western intelligence official pointed to several factors that suggested Russian culpability , namely that Russia controlled the section of dam where the hydropower unit fits into the overall structure — a vulnerable point that could have been exploited to destroy the dam, which was otherwise believed to be structurally sound. “If you have access to the inside of the dam, as they did, you can potentially exploit that vulnerability in a way someone else could not,” the official said.

Ukrainian security services on Friday released a recording of a phone conversation that they said provided evidence that Russia had sabotaged the plant. “It wasn’t them,” a voice, described by the Ukrainians as a Russian soldier, says on the recording, using an expletive to refer to the destruction of the dam. “It was our [guys].” A second soldier says, “[Our] sabotage group was there. They wanted to scare [people] with this dam. It didn’t go according to plan. It was more than they had planned.” The United States has not publicly issued any determination about what happened at the dam on Tuesday, or who — if anyone — was responsible, while Russia has claimed without evidence that Ukraine attacked the dam. Battleground updates The “situation is tense on all areas of the front,” said Maliar, the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, adding that the east is the “epicenter” of the fighting. Like Zelensky, she highlighted developments in Bakhmut. “The enemy is withdrawing reserves and trying to hold the occupied positions,” she said, adding that Ukrainian forces are “conducting active combat operations in several areas” nearby. The embattled city has been a focus for Ukrainian and Russian forces for months.

There have been frequent reports of fires, drone attacks and shelling in Russian areas, particularly near the border, although Kyiv officials have regularly denied any direct involvement.

A Ukrainian tank was seen being destroyed in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to video released by the Russian Defense Ministry on Thursday and independently verified by The Post. An aerial photo of the same scene showed a column of at least six Ukrainian military vehicles, which appeared to include German-made Leopard 2 tanks, according to two military analysts.

Rocket strikes injured eight people in Uman, in the Cherkasy region of central Ukraine, on Thursday evening, regional administration head Ihor Taburets on Thursday evening, regional administration head Ihor Taburets said on Telegram. “There were two hits: on an industrial facility and a carwash. In the second case, a fire broke out as a result of the hit,” he said.

Ukraine and Russia accused each other of shelling people fleeing the flooding after the Kakhovka dam collapse. According to the Ukrainian governor of the region, Oleksandr Prokudin, at least one woman was killed and 17 people were injured in the flooded city of Kherson. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were “fatalities,” without giving a number. Video released by the Russian Defense Ministry on June 8 showed a Ukrainian armored vehicle in flames after being hit by an artillery shell.

From our correspondents A Russia-Ukraine timeline: Key moments, from attack on Kyiv to counteroffensive: The start of the counteroffensive this week marks a new phase in Russia’s 16-month-long war on Ukraine. Share this article Share The war has exacted a massive toll: As many as 120,000 Ukrainian troops and 200,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded. Thousands of civilians also have died, many under flattened buildings, others shot and buried in mass graves. Whole neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble. In the past year, the war has shifted from a fast-moving, multipronged invasion to a battle of attrition concentrated along hundreds of miles of front lines. Both countries have seen their economies devastated, Ukraine’s most acutely but Russia’s, too, from the cost of military mobilizations and the weight of Western sanctions.

What Ukraine Has Lost As Ukraine Launches Counteroffensive, Definitions of ‘Success’ Vary Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Share full article



Ukrainian forces firing at Russian positions in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine on Wednesday. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Julian E. Barnes and June 10, 2023 After months of anticipation, Ukraine’s forces — newly trained on complex warfare tactics and armed with billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weaponry — launched operations on multiple fronts in the past week in an effort to dislodge entrenched Russian military units, a counteroffensive that many officials in the United States and Europe say could be a turning point in the 15-month war. Much rides on the outcome. There is little doubt the new military drive will influence discussions of future support for Ukraine as well as debates about how to guarantee its future. What remains unclear, though, is exactly what the United States, Europe and Ukraine view as a “successful” counteroffensive. Publicly, American and European officials are leaving any definition of success to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. For now, Mr. Zelensky has not laid out any public goals, beyond his oft-stated demand that Russian troops must leave the whole of Ukraine. He is known as a master communicator; any perception that he is backing off that broad ambition would risk undermining his support at a critical moment. Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Still, two themes emerge as clear ideas of “success”: that the Ukrainian army retake and hold on to key swaths of territory previously occupied by the Russians, and that Kyiv deal the Russian military a debilitating blow that forces the Kremlin to question the future of its military options in Ukraine. Some battlefield success, whether by decimating Russia’s army, claiming some territory or both, could help Kyiv secure additional military aid from Europe and the United States. It would also build confidence in allied capitals that their strategy of remaking Ukraine’s forces into a Western-style military is working. And most importantly, such an outcome would build more support in Europe for some sort of long-term security guarantee for Kyiv and strengthen Ukraine’s hand at a bargaining table. Success is not guaranteed. Throughout the war, the Ukrainian army, with deeply motivated troops, creative military operations and advanced Western weaponry, has outperformed Russia’s military. But the Ukrainians have also found it difficult to dislodge the Russians from their entrenched defensive positions in the last few months, with the front lines barely moving.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has given his clearest indication yet that Ukraine’s long-awaited push to liberate territory still held by Russia’s occupying forces is underway, saying “relevant counteroffensive defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine.”

Speaking in Kyiv Saturday, the Ukrainian leader was asked to respond to comments by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who said Friday, “It can be stated with absolute certainty that the [Ukrainian] offensive has begun.”

The Russian leader added that it had not met with any success.

Zelensky shrugged off Putin’s suggestions Ukraine’s armed forces were struggling and sought to apply some psychological pressure of his own.

“It is interesting that Putin was talking about our counteroffensive. It is important that Russia feels [the counteroffensive], feels that they do not have much time left,” he said.

On the battlefield, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported further Ukrainian offensive operations along the frontline to the south and east of Zaporizhzhia.

The Defense Ministry update, posted on its Telegram channel, said that troops from the Vostok brigade immediately to the southeast of the frontline town of Orikhiv, had repelled two attempted advances by Ukrainian tank units, one near the village of Novopokrovka.

In addition, it said two Ukrainian armored columns had been repelled near Novodanilovka and Mala Tamkachka. In the same area, Russian military bloggers said Russian troops in positions close to the road south of Orikhiv towards Tokmak were continuing to report extremely heavy Ukrainian artillery fire.

Further east along the frontline, to the southwest of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk region, the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces had made three further attempted advances, which it said had all been defeated.

Zelensky tight-lipped

CNN is unable to verify Russian defense ministry claims, and the picture is no clearer from the Ukrainian side.

Officials in Kyiv have disclosed little information since they stepped up activities along the front between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk roughly six days ago.

Zelensky, in his comments Saturday at a press conference alongside Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, though referring to counteroffensive activities said, “I will not give any details about the stage it is at.”

After spending most of the winter embroiled in fighting around Bakhmut, as well as training its soldiers and waiting for the arrival of western military aid - like tanks and longer-range strike weapons like Storm Shadow missiles - the last few weeks have seen Ukraine clearly step up military activities.

These have included what are known as shaping operations – strikes on targets far behind front lines, like fuel depots and soldiers’ barracks – and more recently probing operations, where an army conducts what are sometimes called reconnaissance-in-force operations, which are designed to test the enemy’s weak spots as well as its combat readiness.

Despite this, and the comments by the Ukrainian leader Saturday, there is still no evidence that Ukraine has begun a major advance involving large numbers of forces.

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday. Few military campaigns have been as anticipated in recent memory as the current Ukrainian counteroffensive that appears to be underway. For months, speculation built over when and how Ukraine’s forces would strike back across the front lines in the south and east of their country. Kyiv shared little publicly about its plans to retake territory seized in the Russian invasion, though it clamored for Western tanks, infantry vehicles and other sophisticated military aid as it made its preparations.

Spring began to melt into summer. The brutal fighting over the eastern city of Bakhmut captured attention; so, too, the incessant barrage of Russian missiles and drones on civilian areas of Ukraine, including cities far from the main battlefields of the war. The specter of a nuclear escalation loomed darkly over the conflict. And in the past week, we saw a new horror — man-made ecological devastation, as a suspected Russian attack on the Kakhovka reservoir dam along the Dnieper River led to widespread flooding and the evacuation of thousands of civilians.

But now it seems Ukraine is on the march. Though coy on the details, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed as much at a news conference Saturday alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Analysts have concluded that significant operations are in motion on at least three key fronts: Eastward over the bloodied terrain surrounding Bakhmut and toward occupied Luhansk; southeast into the Donetsk region; and southward into parts of the Zaporizhzhia region controlled by Russian troops and toward the Sea of Azov.

Russia has heavily fortified this latter approach, as Ukrainian success there would spell strategic disaster for the Kremlin. “The flat fields of Zaporizhzhia were long seen as a likely and advantageous focal point for the counterattack,” my colleagues explained. “By cutting through here, Kyiv could sever the ‘land bridge’ between mainland Russia and Crimea. This would cut off Russia’s east-west supply lines.”

The region’s “position at the heart of the frontline means that any attack there could trap large numbers of Russian troops in a pocket to the west, in Kherson province,” noted the Economist. “Many could also be trapped in Crimea itself, if Ukraine managed to strike the bridge over the Kerch strait again.” The British magazine added that Ukraine just getting into artillery range of some of the rail and road links to the annexed peninsula would trigger a crisis for Russia.

Political risks rise for Putin as Ukraine’s counteroffensive begins

Ukraine and its allies hope that the superior firepower and training of new Western-backed armored brigades will break through Russia’s reinforced lines. Experts, though, reckon the fighting will be more akin to the attritional slog that preceded Ukraine’s liberation of Kherson than the lightning campaign that routed Russian forces in Kharkiv.

“This isn’t something you judge based on a few days of fighting,” tweeted Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, downplaying social media hand-wringing over published Russian images of a handful of smoldering Ukrainian tanks. “Footage of combat losses, which are to be expected, can have an anchoring effect. The offensive will play out over weeks, and likely months.”

Share this article Share

The end goal for Kyiv is a commanding position from which to turn and face the Kremlin: “If this counteroffensive is indeed successful, the Ukrainians will not only liberate more of their land from a brutal occupation but also might cause more Russians to accept that this is a war they cannot win and persuade the West to keep providing the support Ukraine needs for the long term,” wrote Post columnist Max Boot.

Another Post columnist, David Ignatius, likened the operations to D-Day in World War II and to other offensives in history that serve as “a reminder that an army must sometimes take huge risks to position itself for eventual victory.”

The potent U.S. arsenal for Ukraine’s counteroffensive

Ukraine’s leader is fully aware of the stakes. Amid fears of Western fatigue and, in particular, waning U.S. support as elections draw near, Kyiv wants to show that the significant American and European outlay to buttress its war effort has been worth it — and is also worth sustaining.

“Look, nobody expects as much [from this counteroffensive] as we do,” Zelensky told my colleagues in an interview last month. “I’ll tell you frankly, I’m not sure that absolutely all of our partners believe that we are able to break the Russian Federation.”

Ukraine’s political and security future will be at the heart of discussions next month at a NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius — where months of complicated wrangling over Kyiv’s potential membership in the military alliance and other security guarantees that can be extended to the besieged Ukrainians may come to a head. Within Europe, there are also varying views on how far Ukraine should be encouraged to wage its campaigns before entering negotiations with Russia.

“I know that there is skepticism among some partners that it would be scary if Ukraine liberates absolutely all of its territories,” Zelensky told The Post. “But I, for example, can live with this skepticism. And I believe that the more victories we have on the battlefield, frankly, the more people will believe in us, which means we will get more help.”

Ukraine’s counteroffensive is underway. Here’s what’s at stake.

The Ukrainian counteroffensive also adds to the pressures on the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin has seen the “special military operation” he launched last year sprawl into a ruinous war that has deepened Russia’s geopolitical isolation and gravely depleted its military capacity. Erstwhile supporters now openly challenge the logic and strategy that compelled the invasion, while bracing for worse news to come.

“If Russia loses the corridor to Crimea, it will be a very serious blow,” Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of R-Politik, a political analysis firm with insight into Russia’s halls of power, told my colleagues. “Everyone understands how important it is for Putin and it will mean Putin has again not calculated the situation correctly and again not managed the situation. It will mean a very serious failure.”</div></td>

The stage was set for a spring offensive in the latest phase of Ukraine's efforts to liberate its lands.

However, weeks have passed since modern tanks and weapons were delivered to Ukraine, providing invaluable time for Russia to put together robust physical defences.

Why has Mr Zelenskyy delayed the start of the operation, and will that delay compromise the effectiveness of their spring offensive?

Although fighting continued throughout the winter, poor weather affects warfare - 60-tonne tanks cannot operate off-road effectively unless the ground is dry, so any offence over the winter was constrained.

Instead, Mr Zelenskyy used the winter to persuade the West that Ukraine had the ability and determination to prevail over the much larger Russian army - all he needed were the tanks, weapons and ammunition required to do the job.

The West obliged.

Ukrainian forces then needed time to become familiar with their new Western military equipment. Alongside this, Ukraine has been recruiting and training tens of thousands of new recruits, with much of that training being conducted abroad.

However, any delay has also helped Russia prepare and build more robust and comprehensive defences, and disrupt Ukraine's plans.

The destruction of the Khakovka dam this week protected Russia's flank in Kherson from Ukrainian assault. But, the Ukrainian military will probably have anticipated that eventuality, since the Russians had set demolition charges on the dam since their occupation early last year.

Russia very likely to inflict significant casualties during a Ukrainian counter-offensive

Preparations for a major military offensive are complex - they need to be conducted in secret, involve multiple options, include deception plans, and then it has to be weighed up as to which is most likely to succeed.

The Ukrainian military has proven very adept at pushing Russian forces out of half of Ukrainian territory once held, and there is an air of expectation that Ukraine's counter-offensive could be decisive.

The West might think that the Ukrainians will roll back the Russian forces, but that is only one possible outcome. Russia is - after all - a superpower, and has significant resources available.

It has had time to establish formidable defensive obstacles, and Ukraine will expect to suffer three times as many casualties on offence compared to the Russians on defence.

Russia is very likely to inflict significant casualties on Ukraine, and if the tide swings in Russia's favour they might even decide to mount their own counter-offensive to exploit Ukrainian vulnerability.

How Zelenskyy faces difficult call of weighing up risks of an offensive

Military operations are always risky, prone to unpredictability, and are highly dependent on initiative and momentum.

The anniversary of D-Day was earlier this week - the first phase of the WWII operation to liberate Europe. Germany knew that the allies planned to attack, but like the Russian forces awaiting the Ukraine offensive, they did not know where, or when the attack would occur.

On the eve of D-Day, then prime minister Winston Churchill dined with his wife Clementine, and observed that by supper the following evening, 20,000 soldiers could have perished on the beaches of Normandy.

Even with decades of military and political experience, Churchill felt the heavy burden of responsibility on his shoulders.

Mr Zelenskyy will know the risks and will want to ensure plans are complete and ready before commencing offensive action. However, in war, 90% often has to be "good enough".

The difficult call of whether to go ahead is a mix of objective and subjective metrics which relies heavily on experience and judgement.

Mr Zelenskyy has proven to be an outstanding wartime leader, but he has very limited military experience. He was a politician for three years - and prior to that, he was an actor and comedian.

Although he has very capable military advisers, even they lack experience in this field.

The forthcoming Ukrainian offensive might well prove decisive. However, the stakes could not be higher for the nation of Ukraine or its leadership.

Little wonder that Mr Zelenskyy has taken some time to be satisfied that the potential benefits outweigh the huge risks.

With a few words, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky gave his strongest signal yet that his forces have begun their much-anticipated campaign to regain swathes of territory taken by Russian forces.

The president said “relevant counteroffensive defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine” but remained tight-lipped about the details.

There has long been speculation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, not least as it has been talked up by Ukrainian officials.

But the idea of a counteroffensive may be misleading, giving the impression that there was a discrete before and after period of the campaign.

In reality, Ukraine has been softening up Russian forces for months and is already engaged in efforts to recapture territory. What’s more, as Ukrainians are keen to emphasize, the actions of their armed forces are in response to an invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a joint a press-conference with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, following their meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine on 10 June 2023, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Canada is allocating CAD 500 million (nearly USD 400 million) in military aid to Ukraine, as Ukrinform agency reports. In addition, Canada will extend the mandate of the UNIFIER military training mission until 2026, within the framework of which more than 35,000 Ukrainian soldiers have already been trained in the past eight years. Also Canada will deliver 10,000 105mm rounds and complete in the coming weeks the previously announced delivery of 122 Roshel armored vehicles. So far, 88 such vehicles have arrived in Ukraine, as the media reported. STR/NurPhoto/Getty Images Ukraine's president gives strongest hint yet much anticipated counteroffensive has started

That is why Ukrainian officials like to stress - as Zelensky did with his careful form of words Saturday - that all their actions should be seen as defensive.

Despite all this, the conflict is entering a new stage, and one which may decide its ultimate outcome. Here are some of the factors at play.

Look to the south

Unlike the fluid opening months of the conflict, when Russia attempted to seize the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and other major cities, the frontline in Ukraine is now settled in the south and east.

That also means, as Ukrainian officials acknowledge, the new campaign won’t have the element of surprise, such as during last September’s sweep through the Kharkiv region.

After retaking Kharkiv and Kherson, the southern Zaporizhzhia region will likely be a main focus for the Ukrainian army. It has been stepping up activities there this month.

Gains for Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia could strike a major blow to Russia’s wider campaign. It is seen as a primary objective for Ukraine to break Russia’s land corridor from occupied Donbas to Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014.

In terms of its goals, Kyiv has consistently said that it wants to recapture all of the territory controlled by Russia.

In an address earlier this year Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that included Crimea.

“It is not an intention, it is our land. Crimea is our sea and our mountains,” Zelensky said.

Whether that goal is achievable remains a huge open question.

Russia has dug in – but is vulnerable

Ukraine’s counteroffensive has long been expected by Russia, giving Putin’s army several months to prepare the ground and build an elaborate array of defenses.

Satellite imagery shows the extent of Russian fortification. These include layers of anti-tank ditches, obstacles, minefields and trenches.

Such defenses stretch for hundreds of miles across the meandering front. Breaking through them will prove difficult.

Ukrainian officials have frequently relayed accounts from people in occupied areas such as Mariupol and Berdiansk of long Russian convoys passing through and dozens of buildings being appropriated as military accommodation.

Ukraine has been carrying out so-called shaping operations to lay the groundwork for its offensive, disrupting Russian supply lines, destroying ammunition depots and targeting fuel infrastructure.

Adding to this, there have long been reports of Russian infighting, with particular friction between the Wagner mercenary group and Kremlin military leadership.

Russia’s small gains, especially compared to Putin’s initial ambitious targets in the war, have come at huge cost, decimating frontline units and starving many of manpower, as well as critically important experience.

Bakhmut is still in play

Despite Wagner claiming victory in the eastern city of Bakhmut and handing it back to Russian forces, the city remains a flashpoint.

The city’s fall was a rare gain for Russia but recently Ukraine’s forces say they made limited progress recapturing land to the northwest and southwest.

Ukraine may be using the city to weaken Russia elsewhere by diverting its resources, which similarly may have been the aim of raid by Russian dissident fighters in their home country.

While there are no official figures, it is clear taking Bakhmut came at a huge cost for Russia.

NATO intelligence estimates that for every Ukrainian soldier killed defending Bakhmut, Russian forces lost at least five.

Ukraine has new weapons at its disposal

Ukraine upgraded its weaponry ahead of the counteroffensive.

The United Kingdom delivered multiple “Storm Shadow” cruise missiles to Ukraine, giving the nation a new long-range strike capability.

With a firing range in excess of 250km, or 155 miles, it is just short of the 185-mile range capability of the US-made surface-to-surface Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, that Ukraine has long asked for.

Ukraine has also received at least two Patriot systems, one from the United States and one from Germany, to enhance its air defenses, which have previously been unable to intercept more modern Russian missiles.

Proving its new prowess last month, Ukraine for the first time used a US-made Patriot air defense system to intercept a Russian hypersonic missile, marking a potentially pivotal moment in the conflict.

In addition to military equipment, the US announced a $1.2 billion aid package to Ukraine to support the launch of its counteroffensive.

The clock is ticking

A question mark hangs over how long the international support for Ukraine will last.

Next year’s US election looms, and comments made by ex-president Donald Trump during a CNN Town Hall raised the possibility that the so far strong US support for Ukraine could end.

During the meeting Trump refused to say whether who he wanted to win the conflict, saying instead he wanted “everybody to stop dying.”

The longer the war goes on, the more likely divisions are to grow among Ukaine’s allies, something that will play to Russia’s advantage.

Email Icon Save Layered Russian defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines Advancing Ukrainian troops must break through an elaborate network of Russian defences running hundreds of miles across the country that were built in anticipation of Kyiv’s offensive. With the initial assaults now underway, new satellite imagery provided to The Telegraph by Maxar Technologies has revealed the array of minefields, anti-tank ditches, and trenches lying ahead of the Ukrainian troops attempting to push south. The defences, according to a Ukrainian intelligence officer, are constructed in a “three-line system”, with varying levels of fortifications, the depths of which can exceed around 19 miles on some axes. “They have unbelievable trenches and unbelievable fortifications, it will be hard to break their lines of defence” Serhii, a commander in Ukraine’s National Guards, told The Telegraph. “There are also minefields and they have good artillery - more than us unfortunately.” These layered defences have sprung up along the more than 600 miles of front lines separating Ukrainian forces from the Russian occupiers. For more than six months, Ukraine has been preparing 12 new offensive brigades, including nine armed and trained by Nato nations, for the task at hand. This time has given Russia ample time to build fortifications in the areas most likely expected to be targeted by Kyiv - occupied Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s south and the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east. One of the new satellite images shows trenches carefully carved into agricultural land outside the town of Mykhailivka, around 40 miles west of Tokmak, where Ukrainian forces are reportedly making a push. Russia’s fortifications in southern Ukraine The carefully-constructed ditches stretch for miles across a series of farmers’ fields, serving as a rear defensive position on the lands occupied by Moscow’s forces. In a sign of Russian caution, the array of trenches seen in the images are positioned almost 19 miles behind the current front lines. Other satellite images show deep trenches just in front of a tree line, which is then used to disguise artillery positions that can strike approaching forces. Ukrainian soldiers prepare for battle on the front line south of Bakhmut Credit : Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Closer to the front, Moscow’s forces have deployed triangular concrete blocks known as “dragons’ teeth” in a bid to slow Ukrainian armour in any attempted push south. One satellite image taken in March shows hundreds of the anti-tank structures arranged in rows, as well as personnel trenches, just east of Vaylivka, a city which sits on a road junction heading towards occupied Melitopol. And ahead of those, while not visible to the satellite, would likely be a vast network of minefields aimed at stopping any initial drive south by Ukrainian troops. The layered defensive system Ukrainian troops must break through “The first line, along the line of contact, comprises the fighting positions made by the infantry,” according to a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute. “The second constitutes properly made trenches as compared with fox holes in the first – and concrete firing posts where possible. “Several obstacle belts are laid in front of these positions, usually formed with a 4m deep and 6m wide anti-tank ditch, dragons’ teeth and wire track entanglements. “The depth of defence is usually 5km from the first, and each belt of physical defences tends to span between 700m and a kilometre, so that the entire obstacle series is covered by fire. “The third line usually comprises full-back fighting positions and concealed areas for reserves, with positions dug for vehicles.” Ukrainian soldiers wade through floodwater in Afanasiyivka following the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam this week Credit : OLEKSII FILIPPOV/AFP/Getty Images British intelligence officials have described the Russian efforts to fortify their positions as “some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world”. Recent analysis of these positions suggest they could stretch across the entire front line from occupied Crimea to the Donbas. Ukrainian troops have even grown to admire their enemy’s ability to construct trenches, an admission that the counter-offensive is unlikely to be as easy as some observers expect. “We should learn from our enemy on how they construct their trenches, because they are so excellent at that,” Serhii, the intelligence officer, said. “They use specialised vehicles, not only hands.” License this content Advertisement More stories</div></td>

The Ukrainian leader made the comment on Saturday at a news conference in Kyiv, while standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

He was responding to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement a day earlier that Ukraine’s counteroffensive had started and that Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses”.

Zelenskyy said that “counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.”

“I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders.

“Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.”

Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was under way, though some Western analysts have said fiercer fighting and reported use of reserve troops suggests it was.

In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy provided few details while urging troops to keep fighting.

“Thank you to all those who hold their positions and those who advance,” he said, citing the eastern and southern fronts, where fighting is heaviest.

Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had repelled enemy attacks around Bakhmut and Marinka, sites of heavy clashes in the east. Russian forces, it said, “continue to suffer heavy losses which they are trying to conceal”.

Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar made it plain on Telegram that the military would issue no statements until battlefield positions became clear.

“Ask yourself this… am I prepared to receive information about the liberation of this or that town not when our troops enter it, but once they establish a stronghold?” she wrote.

Ukraine has said for months it plans to conduct a significant counteroffensive to recapture land occupied by Russia in the south and east. But it is enforcing strict operational silence for now and has denied it has begun the main operation.

With scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been difficult to assess the state of the fighting.

‘Significant’ operations

The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said Ukraine had conducted “significant” operations in several eastern and southern parts in the last 48 hours, with Russian defences breached in places.

“In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower,” it said, also characterising the Russian military’s performance as mixed.

“Some [Russian] units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields,” it said.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive is expected to use thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West but Russia has built huge fortifications in occupied territory to prepare, while Kyiv also lacks air supremacy.

Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert at the University of Bath in the UK, told Al Jazeera that the counteroffensive was likely to be a “long game” and that its initial operations would “probably be the most bloody part for the Ukrainians”.

“It’s highly unlikely that we’re going to see a rapid breakthrough like we saw in Kharkiv back in September, for example, where the Ukrainians were able to, with the help of allied intelligence, identify places where there were just exhausted and ruined Russian units and drove essentially past them and kept going. It’s not going to be like that,” he said.

“The Russians have had months to prepare significant offences and these are … defensive positions with trenches, bunkers, minefields, in particular, which are designed to channel attackers into killing zones.”

The Ukrainians were likely to take “a lot of casualties” while going on the attack.

“It’s much easier to defend: You know the ground, you know what the plan is, you know ‘I’m going to hold this position until they get to here and then I’m going to fall back to here, and then that other position is going to support me’,” Bury said.

“It’s significantly easier for the defenders as the Ukrainians found out when they were defending last year. It’s much more difficult for the attackers,” he added. “Yes, you have some intelligence preparation but you don’t know exactly where everything is; it’s all new to you, the terrain and you’re being fired on etc as you try to advance; so it’s much more difficult for them.”

The south is seen as a key strategic priority for a Ukrainian push that could aim to recapture Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and cut the Russian land bridge to the occupied Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, dividing Russian forces.

The fighting there has drawn renewed attention following the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam along the Dnipro River on Tuesday.

The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparked fears of humanitarian and environmental disasters. Ukraine says Russia blew up the dam. Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing on it.

Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since the dam’s breach, offered up monetary, military and moral support.

He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375m) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6bn) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5m) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response.

Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war”, but he did not blame Moscow directly.

In other developments, the UK government also said it will give 16 million pounds ($20m) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding.

Most of the money is being channelled through international organisations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations. The UK is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he wanted to continue speaking with Putin and plans to do so again “soon”.

Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops.

“That needs to be understood,” he said.</div></td>

With a few words, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky gave his strongest signal yet that his forces have begun their much-anticipated campaign to regain swathes of territory taken by Russian forces.

The president said “relevant counteroffensive defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine” but remained tight-lipped about the details.

There has long been speculation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, not least as it has been talked up by Ukrainian officials.

But the idea of a counteroffensive may be misleading, giving the impression that there was a discrete before and after period of the campaign.

In reality, Ukraine has been softening up Russian forces for months and is already engaged in efforts to recapture territory. What’s more, as Ukrainians are keen to emphasize, the actions of their armed forces are in response to an invasion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a joint a press-conference with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, following their meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine on 10 June 2023, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Canada is allocating CAD 500 million (nearly USD 400 million) in military aid to Ukraine, as Ukrinform agency reports. In addition, Canada will extend the mandate of the UNIFIER military training mission until 2026, within the framework of which more than 35,000 Ukrainian soldiers have already been trained in the past eight years. Also Canada will deliver 10,000 105mm rounds and complete in the coming weeks the previously announced delivery of 122 Roshel armored vehicles. So far, 88 such vehicles have arrived in Ukraine, as the media reported. STR/NurPhoto/Getty Images Ukraine's president gives strongest hint yet much anticipated counteroffensive has started

That is why Ukrainian officials like to stress - as Zelensky did with his careful form of words Saturday - that all their actions should be seen as defensive.

Despite all this, the conflict is entering a new stage, and one which may decide its ultimate outcome. Here are some of the factors at play.

Look to the south

Unlike the fluid opening months of the conflict, when Russia attempted to seize the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and other major cities, the frontline in Ukraine is now settled in the south and east.

That also means, as Ukrainian officials acknowledge, the new campaign won’t have the element of surprise, such as during last September’s sweep through the Kharkiv region.

After retaking Kharkiv and Kherson, the southern Zaporizhzhia region will likely be a main focus for the Ukrainian army. It has been stepping up activities there this month.

Gains for Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia could strike a major blow to Russia’s wider campaign. It is seen as a primary objective for Ukraine to break Russia’s land corridor from occupied Donbas to Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014.

In terms of its goals, Kyiv has consistently said that it wants to recapture all of the territory controlled by Russia.

In an address earlier this year Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that included Crimea.

“It is not an intention, it is our land. Crimea is our sea and our mountains,” Zelensky said.

Whether that goal is achievable remains a huge open question.

Russia has dug in – but is vulnerable

Ukraine’s counteroffensive has long been expected by Russia, giving Putin’s army several months to prepare the ground and build an elaborate array of defenses.

Satellite imagery shows the extent of Russian fortification. These include layers of anti-tank ditches, obstacles, minefields and trenches.

Such defenses stretch for hundreds of miles across the meandering front. Breaking through them will prove difficult.

Ukrainian officials have frequently relayed accounts from people in occupied areas such as Mariupol and Berdiansk of long Russian convoys passing through and dozens of buildings being appropriated as military accommodation.

Ukraine has been carrying out so-called shaping operations to lay the groundwork for its offensive, disrupting Russian supply lines, destroying ammunition depots and targeting fuel infrastructure.

Adding to this, there have long been reports of Russian infighting, with particular friction between the Wagner mercenary group and Kremlin military leadership.

Russia’s small gains, especially compared to Putin’s initial ambitious targets in the war, have come at huge cost, decimating frontline units and starving many of manpower, as well as critically important experience.

Bakhmut is still in play

Despite Wagner claiming victory in the eastern city of Bakhmut and handing it back to Russian forces, the city remains a flashpoint.

The city’s fall was a rare gain for Russia but recently Ukraine’s forces say they made limited progress recapturing land to the northwest and southwest.

Ukraine may be using the city to weaken Russia elsewhere by diverting its resources, which similarly may have been the aim of raid by Russian dissident fighters in their home country.

While there are no official figures, it is clear taking Bakhmut came at a huge cost for Russia.

NATO intelligence estimates that for every Ukrainian soldier killed defending Bakhmut, Russian forces lost at least five.

Ukraine has new weapons at its disposal

Ukraine upgraded its weaponry ahead of the counteroffensive.

The United Kingdom delivered multiple “Storm Shadow” cruise missiles to Ukraine, giving the nation a new long-range strike capability.

With a firing range in excess of 250km, or 155 miles, it is just short of the 185-mile range capability of the US-made surface-to-surface Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, that Ukraine has long asked for.

Ukraine has also received at least two Patriot systems, one from the United States and one from Germany, to enhance its air defenses, which have previously been unable to intercept more modern Russian missiles.

Proving its new prowess last month, Ukraine for the first time used a US-made Patriot air defense system to intercept a Russian hypersonic missile, marking a potentially pivotal moment in the conflict.

In addition to military equipment, the US announced a $1.2 billion aid package to Ukraine to support the launch of its counteroffensive.

The clock is ticking

A question mark hangs over how long the international support for Ukraine will last.

Next year’s US election looms, and comments made by ex-president Donald Trump during a CNN Town Hall raised the possibility that the so far strong US support for Ukraine could end.

During the meeting Trump refused to say whether who he wanted to win the conflict, saying instead he wanted “everybody to stop dying.”

The longer the war goes on, the more likely divisions are to grow among Ukaine’s allies, something that will play to Russia’s advantage.

If the war ends in negotiations or stalemate, Ukraine will want an upper hand. It will be seeking to make as many gains as it can from the counteroffensive, and fast.</div></td>

"Counter-offensive and defensive actions are taking place," he said.

But he added that he would not talk in detail about which stage or state the counter-offensive was in.

The comments come after an escalation of fighting in the south and east of Ukraine and speculation about progress of the widely anticipated push.

Ukrainian troops are reported to have advanced in the east near Bakhmut and in the south near Zaporizhzhia, and have carried out long-range strikes on Russian targets.

But assessing the reality on the front lines is difficult, with the two warring sides presenting contrasting narratives: Ukraine claiming progress and Russia that it is fighting off attacks.

Meanwhile in Russia's Kaluga region - which borders the southern districts around Moscow - governor Vladislav Shapsha said on Telegram that a drone crashed near the village of Strelkovk early on Sunday. The BBC has not independently verified the report.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a video interview published Friday that Ukrainian forces had certainly begun their offensive but that attempted advances had failed with heavy casualties.

Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday after talks with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Mr Zelensky described the Russian leader's words as "interesting".

Ukrainian forces firing at Russian positions in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine on Wednesday. Credit... Tyler Hicks/The New York Times Julian E. Barnes and June 10, 2023 After months of anticipation, Ukraine’s forces — newly trained on complex warfare tactics and armed with billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weaponry — launched operations on multiple fronts in the past week in an effort to dislodge entrenched Russian military units, a counteroffensive that many officials in the United States and Europe say could be a turning point in the 15-month war. Much rides on the outcome. There is little doubt the new military drive will influence discussions of future support for Ukraine as well as debates about how to guarantee its future. What remains unclear, though, is exactly what the United States, Europe and Ukraine view as a “successful” counteroffensive. Publicly, American and European officials are leaving any definition of success to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. For now, Mr. Zelensky has not laid out any public goals, beyond his oft-stated demand that Russian troops must leave the whole of Ukraine. He is known as a master communicator; any perception that he is backing off that broad ambition would risk undermining his support at a critical moment. Privately, U.S. and European officials concede that pushing all of Russia’s forces out of occupied Ukrainian land is highly unlikely. Still, two themes emerge as clear ideas of “success”: that the Ukrainian army retake and hold on to key swaths of territory previously occupied by the Russians, and that Kyiv deal the Russian military a debilitating blow that forces the Kremlin to question the future of its military options in Ukraine. Some battlefield success, whether by decimating Russia’s army, claiming some territory or both, could help Kyiv secure additional military aid from Europe and the United States. It would also build confidence in allied capitals that their strategy of remaking Ukraine’s forces into a Western-style military is working. And most importantly, such an outcome would build more support in Europe for some sort of long-term security guarantee for Kyiv and strengthen Ukraine’s hand at a bargaining table. Success is not guaranteed. Throughout the war, the Ukrainian army, with deeply motivated troops, creative military operations and advanced Western weaponry, has outperformed Russia’s military. But the Ukrainians have also found it difficult to dislodge the Russians from their entrenched defensive positions in the last few months, with the front lines barely moving.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has given his clearest indication yet that Ukraine’s long-awaited push to liberate territory still held by Russia’s occupying forces is underway, saying “relevant counteroffensive defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine.”

Speaking in Kyiv Saturday, the Ukrainian leader was asked to respond to comments by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who said Friday, “It can be stated with absolute certainty that the [Ukrainian] offensive has begun.”

The Russian leader added that it had not met with any success.

Zelensky shrugged off Putin’s suggestions Ukraine’s armed forces were struggling and sought to apply some psychological pressure of his own.

“It is interesting that Putin was talking about our counteroffensive. It is important that Russia feels [the counteroffensive], feels that they do not have much time left,” he said.

On the battlefield, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported further Ukrainian offensive operations along the frontline to the south and east of Zaporizhzhia.

The Defense Ministry update, posted on its Telegram channel, said that troops from the Vostok brigade immediately to the southeast of the frontline town of Orikhiv, had repelled two attempted advances by Ukrainian tank units, one near the village of Novopokrovka.

In addition, it said two Ukrainian armored columns had been repelled near Novodanilovka and Mala Tamkachka. In the same area, Russian military bloggers said Russian troops in positions close to the road south of Orikhiv towards Tokmak were continuing to report extremely heavy Ukrainian artillery fire.

Further east along the frontline, to the southwest of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk region, the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces had made three further attempted advances, which it said had all been defeated.

Zelensky tight-lipped

CNN is unable to verify Russian defense ministry claims, and the picture is no clearer from the Ukrainian side.

Officials in Kyiv have disclosed little information since they stepped up activities along the front between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk roughly six days ago.

Zelensky, in his comments Saturday at a press conference alongside Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, though referring to counteroffensive activities said, “I will not give any details about the stage it is at.”

After spending most of the winter embroiled in fighting around Bakhmut, as well as training its soldiers and waiting for the arrival of western military aid - like tanks and longer-range strike weapons like Storm Shadow missiles - the last few weeks have seen Ukraine clearly step up military activities.

These have included what are known as shaping operations – strikes on targets far behind front lines, like fuel depots and soldiers’ barracks – and more recently probing operations, where an army conducts what are sometimes called reconnaissance-in-force operations, which are designed to test the enemy’s weak spots as well as its combat readiness.

Despite this, and the comments by the Ukrainian leader Saturday, there is still no evidence that Ukraine has begun a major advance involving large numbers of forces.

While Russia’s defensive fortifications are impressive in their size and scale—at least in some respects—they are likely insufficient to prevent Ukrainian forces from breaking through Russian lines and retaking territory illegally seized by Russia. In short, Russian defensive actions do not guarantee that the defense has the advantage. Several steps could shift the advantage to the offense.

Weakness of Defensive Forces

Fortifications are only as good as the forces defending them. In the 1930s, France constructed the Maginot Line, which included concrete fortifications, machine guns, anti-tank emplacements, and even underground railways. The Maginot Line had state-of-the-art living conditions for specialist units of infantry, artillery, and engineers—even including air conditioning. But the French military was relatively weak. It had a debilitated air force and a large army that was unprepared for offensive operations, though it had a reasonably strong navy.[19] Germany exploited these French weaknesses during its invasion of France in 1940.

The Russian military—especially the army—has been battered over the past year. Following its February 2022 invasion, Russia failed to achieve many of its objectives in Ukraine because of poor combined arms operations; ineffective joint operations, such as close air support to Russian ground forces; problematic intelligence, including faulty Federal Security Service planning and analysis; significant logistical problems; and low morale. These factors were vital for Ukraine’s lightning offensive in Kharkiv Oblast in 2022, where Ukrainian forces achieved operational surprise, broke through Russian lines, and captured a key logistical hub to trigger a collapse among Russian ground forces and the liberation of more than 12,000 square kilometers of territory.[20]

The deployment of Wagner Group private military contractors to the front lines in eastern Ukraine in 2023 has further highlighted the poor performance of Russian ground forces, as well as the political risks of a full-scale Russian mobilization. Consequently, a partially bruised and demoralized Russian army sits behind the extensive fortifications, which may present opportunities for Ukraine.

Furthermore, the Russian military likely does not have enough high-quality forces to defend all parts of the line. The 70 combat regiments and brigades Russia has in Ukraine will likely not be sufficient to form a large mobile reserve, even if Russia commands enough soldiers to adequately staff its fortifications.[21] The lack of a strong mobile reserve means that Russia will be hard-pressed to surge forces to fill gaps in its lines, station forces in second-echelon defensive positions, and conduct counterattacks according to its defensive doctrine.[22]

Expansive Front Line

Ukraine can use the extensive front line to its advantage. Territory can be important, particularly the size of a front and the territory an attacker is attempting to seize. While the Maginot Line in France covered approximately 450 kilometers, it did not cover every inch of French territory or key parts of France’s border with Belgium and Luxembourg. Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium in May 1940. Later that month, German forces penetrated the Maginot Line at a weak part along the Belgian frontier, where France’s defenses had few forces that were of relatively low quality. On May 15, 1940, Heinz Guderian’s XIX Panzer Corps broke through the French line and headed west into open country, sealing France’s fate.[23]

One historical lesson for Ukraine and its Western supporters is to continue assessing weak spots in the Russian lines where there are opportunities for penetration, where Russian defenses are poorly constructed or of insufficient depth, and where Russian forces are understaffed or of particularly poor quality.[24] Ukrainian forces know this terrain well, since it is land many of their soldiers grew up on.

The formidable appearance of Russia’s defensive fortifications may also obscure as much as it reveals. Russia has used contractors to dig trenches, many of whom likely lack significant military engineering experience.[25] There have also been reports of Russian mistreatment of these contractors.[26] Lack of expertise or low morale could lead to the fortifications being less effective than they appear in satellite imagery.

Variation in the quality of Russia’s dragon’s teeth is notable, despite the media attention they have generated as a symbol of Russia’s defenses in Ukraine. These obstacles are most effective when connected to one another by concrete linkages underground and partially buried. Some images appear to show dragon’s teeth without underground connections. Other images appear to show dragon’s teeth sitting on top of the earth rather than partially under it. One image posted on several Russian websites also appears to show that some of the dragon’s teeth used by Russia are not entirely made of concrete and are already suffering environmental damage in Ukraine.[27] It is impossible to draw sweeping conclusions about the overall quality of Russia’s defenses from these images, but they are enough to suggest that there are variations in the quality of defenses across the line that can be exploited by Ukraine with good intelligence.

The Ukrainian front covers roughly 1,000 kilometers—more than double the size of the Maginot Line—as it zigzags from the grassy slopes of the northeast, hugs the Dnipro River, and extends to the Black Sea.[28] This large front is likely a major vulnerability for the Russians. As one assessment of the offense-defense balance concludes, “If the attacker is faced with a defender who is protecting a narrow front, the probability that the blitzkrieg will succeed is much less than if the attacker can strike at a defender deployed across a broad front.”[29] This challenge is often called the force-to-space ratio.[30] Russia likely lacks the force-to-space ratio to defend such an expansive territory.

The May 2023 clashes between Russian security forces and fighters in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast, near the Ukrainian border, likely worsened Russia’s deployment problems by forcing the Russian military to move troops to its internationally recognized border with Ukraine.[31] These types of attacks could increase Russia’s force-to-space ratio problems by thinning out its defensive positions in some areas.

Technology and Military Innovation

Technology can impact the offense-defense balance. The offense generally requires mobility.[32] The attacker must first achieve a breakthrough by defeating or destroying a section of the defender’s front, and then it must exploit this breakthrough to advance into the defender’s rear.[33] As noted earlier in this analysis, advances in military mobility have sometimes shifted the balance in favor of the offense.[34]

The Ukrainian military has thus far been innovative in its development and use of technology.[35] Military innovation involves a change in the conduct of warfare intended to improve the ability of a military to generate combat power. A change in the conduct of warfare does not necessarily require a change in military doctrine, but it does involve change at the operational level of war.[36]

One example of Ukrainian innovation has been the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) in combined arms warfare, which includes the blending of infantry, direct and indirect fire, aviation, and other joint capabilities to achieve political and military objectives.[37] Ukraine has utilized UASs to conduct several types of missions as part of combined arms warfare, such as target identification for artillery, strike, battlefield damage assessment, and information operations.[38]

The challenge for Ukraine will be to innovatively utilize technology and adapt its conduct of warfare in ways that maximize mobility to exploit Russian vulnerabilities. For example, Ukrainian forces could use a combination of advanced technology and UASs or loitering munitions—including those supplied by the West—to conduct UAS “swarms” against Russian defensive positions. As interviews with Ukrainian military officials indicate, Ukraine is investing significant time and resources into innovations such as swarming tactics designed to maximize target saturation and overwhelm Russian defenses.[39] UASs could also be employed to probe for gaps in Russian lines, locate Russian reserves or artillery systems, or provide artillery-like effects in support of high-mobility units exploiting a breakthrough.

An important technological obstacle to Ukraine’s efforts is Russia’s electronic warfare capabilities. Russia has effectively used electronic warfare to combat Ukrainian UASs.[40] The ability of the Ukrainian military to find and destroy Russian electronic warfare systems, which are now organic to units at multiple levels, will be a key enabler of offensive success.

Strategy, Force Employment, Will to Fight, and Other Intangibles

Attackers can make up for a tough defense with clever strategies, effective force employment, leadership, nationalism, will to fight, combat motivation, morale, and other factors. Force employment, for example, includes how militaries use force on the battlefield—a combination of cover, concealment, dispersion, suppression, small-unit independent maneuver, and combined arms operations.[41] Some also call this “military skill,” which describes a country’s ability to effectively employ military technology, including designing military strategy and assessing adversaries’ forces and strategy.[42]

Will to fight and nationalism can influence the offense-defense balance, and neither have been in short supply among Ukrainians. To the extent that soldiers are motivated by nationalism, they frequently become willing to fight harder for territory that they understand to be part of their national homeland.[43] The Ukrainian military and civilians have shown an extraordinary will to fight since the start of the war.

The reverse is also true: soldiers who are not imbued with a nationalist consciousness may be less willing to fight for territory. Confederate soldiers deserted the Army of Northern Virginia at the Potomac in 1862 because “they felt that they were fighting to defend Virginia’s soil, not to invade the North.”[44] In addition, Hitler was unwilling to risk imposing full war mobilization on Germany until the failure of Operation Barbarossa opened the possibility that Germany’s own homeland security might be threatened.[45]

Despite President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that Ukraine is part of the Russian empire, it is unclear how much this argument has convinced Russian soldiers and contractors. Recent research on absent without leave (AWOL) cases in Russian military courts suggests that an increasing number of Russian military personnel are not convinced. AWOL cases in the first four months of 2023 already surpassed the total number of cases in 2022.[46] It is impossible to say definitively that the rise indicates that Russians in Ukraine have a low will to fight, but it is hardly an indicator of a strongly motivated military.

A clever strategy is also important. Between 1919 and 1945, an evolving offensive doctrine (blitzkrieg) and motorized armor shifted the advantage to the offense and overrode machine guns, trenches, railroads, and barbed wire.[47] As B.H. Liddell Hart explained in analyzing German General Heinz Guderian’s blitzkrieg into France in May 1940:

"It is clear that Guderian and his tankmen pulled the German Army along after them, and thereby produced the most sweeping victory in modern history.

The issue turned on the time factor at stage after stage. French countermovements were repeatedly thrown out of gear because their timing was too slow to catch up with changing situations, and that was due to the fact that the German van kept on moving faster than the German high command had contemplated."[48]

In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel Defense Forces heavily relied on armor and air forces to destroy significant components of the Egyptian and Syrian air forces. Within three days, the Israelis captured the Gaza Strip and all of the Sinai Peninsula up to the east bank of the Suez Canal. Israeli forces then drove Jordanian troops out of East Jerusalem and most of the West Bank and seized the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel developed an effective blitzkrieg strategy that relied on armor to inflict a decisive defeat against its Arab adversaries. As Moshe Dayan explained to Israel’s Ministerial Defense Committee before the war, “If we opened the attack and effected an armored breakthrough into Sinai, the enemy would be forced to fight according to the moves we made.”[49]

For Ukraine today, maneuver warfare demands a flexible command structure with soldiers capable of exercising initiative in combat situations. It is not based on a rigid plan that commanders need to follow closely.[50] Ukrainian soldiers at the platoon, company, and battalion levels have already shown a proclivity to taking the initiative. In World War II, the German military developed a doctrine of Auftragstaktik, which dictated that commanders be given a battlefield objective rather than lengthy orders that micromanaged how they do it.[51] This doctrine helped enable implementation of blitzkrieg, which requires lower-level commanders to act quickly and decisively in order to exploit breakthroughs and maintain the momentum required to avoid enemy counterattack.

A clever Ukrainian strategy that penetrates Russian lines could have significant follow-on effects. For example, a major breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia could severely threaten the viability of Russia’s land bridge linking Russia’s Rostov region with Crimea. Even a breakthrough in the less-densely defended Luhansk Oblast could provide significant benefits by proving that Western support for Ukraine continues to bear fruit, removing Russian units from the battlefield, and sowing further dissent within Russia itself.

Next Steps

The next phase of the war will hinge, in part, on the ability of Ukrainian forces to retake territory by moving from attrition to maneuver warfare and to shift the offense-defense balance in favor of the offense. As Napoleon wrote, “The strength of an army, like power in mechanics, is estimated by multiplying the mass by the velocity.”[52] A Ukrainian maneuver strategy places a premium on the second factor—velocity. Russian forces have attempted to shift the advantage to the defense and retain the territory they have conquered in Ukraine by constructing a formidable system of fortifications. But Russia faces several challenges in holding this territory, including weak ground forces that have not performed well on the battlefield, the need to defend a massive amount of territory, and variable construction of the fortifications.

This war is far from over. Western aid—including weapons systems, technology, training, intelligence, and financial support—will be critical over the long run to help Ukraine retake its territory and prevent Russia from invading again in the foreseeable future. The future trajectory of the war will also depend on whether Ukraine can exploit Russian vulnerabilities and effectively integrate technology, a clever strategy, force employment, nationalism, and other factors to turn the tide.

The extensive Russian defensive fortifications described in the articles suggest that breaking through these defenses could be challenging for Ukrainian forces.<br>2. There is an acknowledgment from U.S. and European officials that pushing all Russian forces out of Ukraine is unlikely, indicating the high level of difficulty the counteroffensive faces.<br>3. The Ukrainian offensive thus far has shown mixed results, which suggests that progress may be slower than needed to achieve the control of Polohy by the 1st of October.<br><br>Strength of reasons for no:<br>1. The strong and elaborate defensive positions built by the Russians are typically difficult to penetrate, which could significantly slow down Ukrainian advances. This reason is strong due to the physical barriers to progress.<br>2. The skepticism of international officials reflects a realistic assessment of the situation on the ground, providing a moderate to strong reason to doubt the likelihood of a quick Ukrainian advance.<br>3. Mixed results in the offensive so far suggest that sustained progress may be challenging to maintain, giving this reason a moderate strength.<br><br>Reasons why the answer might be yes:<br>1. Ukrainian troops have shown resilience and the will to fight, and they have been making strategic preparations for the counteroffensive, including forming new battalions and acquiring Western tanks and AFVs.<br>2. Ukrainian forces have potentially exploitable advantages, such as weaknesses in the Russian military, poor combined arms operations, logistical problems, and low morale on the Russian side.<br>3. The Ukrainian spring counteroffensive appears to be imminent, and with Ukrainian forces reportedly advancing in the east and south, Polohy could be retaken if momentum is on their side.<br><br>Strength of reasons for yes:<br>1. Preparation and morale are essential for successful operations, and Ukrainian efforts imply a moderate strength to this reason due to improved capabilities and equipment.<br>2. If Ukrainian forces can capitalize on Russian weaknesses, there is a chance of operational success. However, exploiting these weaknesses requires precision and coordination, making this reason of moderate strength.<br>3. Imminency and reports of advances demonstrate potential, but without specific details and evidence of significant progress, the strength of this reason is moderate.<br><br>Aggregated Considerations:<br>The strength of the entrenched Russian defenses and the understanding of international observers suggest caution in anticipating rapid Ukrainian success. However, there are also factors that could lead to Ukrainian advances, including battlefield dynamics and potential weaknesses on the Russian side. Nonetheless, the uncertainty inherent in the fog of war and rapidly changing circumstances make definitive predictions difficult.<br><br>Given the breadth and depth of defenses to overcome within a four-month timeline, which entails significant logistical and tactical challenges, there is a strong likelihood that achieving control of Polohy by October 1, 2023, could be quite challenging for Ukraine.<br><br>Output:<br>Taking into account the arguments for both yes and no, it seems appropriate to lean towards the negative while allowing for the possibility that events could unfold differently:<br><br>*0.35*</div></td>

Ukraine is planning to launch a counter-offensive to retake territory captured by Russian forces, and Polohy is a potential target due to its proximity to the frontline.<br>2. Ukraine has reportedly formed new battalizations with Western tanks and AFVs in preparation for the offensive.<br>3. The Russian military has constructed extensive defensive fortifications that could challenge the Ukrainian advance.<br>4. While Ukrainian forces have managed to liberate some areas in Donetsk, the reports suggest the counter-offensive has shown mixed results thus far.<br>5. Ukrainian President Zelensky has confirmed the start of the counter-offensive, indicating a sense of urgency and determination to push back Russian forces.<br>6. International support continues to play a crucial role in the conflict, with Western aid being a significant factor in Ukraine's military capabilities.<br>7. There are inherent uncertainties in warfare, including logistic complexities, potential changes in tactical situations, and the fog of war, making specific predictions difficult.<br><br>Aggregating considerations:<br><br>- The timeframe for the summer counter-offensive aligns with the date range of the question, and there is momentum and intention expressed by the Ukrainian leadership to reclaim lost territories.<br>- Russian defenses are reportedly strong, and Ukraine may face significant obstacles in penetrating these fortifications to achieve territorial gains.<br>- Mixed results from initial counter-offensive actions suggest a level of unpredictability in the outcomes of military operations.<br>- President Zelenskyy's statements indicate confidence and the commencement of counter-offensive actions, which could suggest potential progress towards retaking areas like Polohy.<br>- Extended engagement from the West and advanced weaponry provided to Ukraine could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of Ukrainian forces.<br>- Historical precedent in conflicts suggests that even with a strong desire and preparation for an offensive, actual results may vary greatly due to unpredictable factors and enemy resistance.<br>- The question seems to be considering the initial success of the Ukrainian offensive, not the consolidation of gains, which might increase the probability of a "Yes" outcome if only a temporary control or liberation is achieved.<br><br>Answer: Based on the mixture of aggressive Ukrainian preparations and noteworthy Russian defenses, the various factors at play create a challenging but not impossible scenario for Ukraine to retake Polohy. The uncertainty in combat outcomes is high, so while there is potential for success, it is not assured. Considering these points, I would estimate a moderate probability of success.<br><br>*0.5*</div></td>

New satellite images reveal minefields, anti-tank ditches, and trenches spanning over 600 miles of front lines. Russian forces have constructed a three-line system of fortifications, including deep trenches, dragons' teeth, and wire track entanglements. The extensive defensive works have impressed Ukrainian troops, indicating that the counter-offensive may not be as straightforward as anticipated. With the counter-offensive imminent, the likelihood of Ukraine retaking Polohy by October 1, 2023, remains uncertain given the formidable Russian fortifications and the potential difficulty in breaking through them.<br><br>[2] Ukraine is counter-attacking in multiple directions, with mixed results (published on 2023-06-11)<br>Summary: Ukraine's recent counter-offensive against Russia has shown mixed results, with progress made in liberating villages in Donetsk province.

The UK Ministry of Defence reported significant operations in eastern and southern Ukraine, with Russian defences breached in some areas. However, the counteroffensive is expected to be a long and difficult process, with Ukraine likely to suffer casualties.

However, the reality on the front lines is difficult to assess, with conflicting narratives from both sides. Russian President Putin claimed that Ukrainian advances had failed with heavy casualties. Zelensky, after talks with Canadian PM Trudeau, responded to Putin's words by saying it was important that Russia felt "they do not have long left" and that Ukraine's military commanders were in a positive mood.

The success of the offensive is crucial for future support and security guarantees for Ukraine. While President Zelensky has not publicly defined success, privately, U.S. and European officials acknowledge that pushing all Russian forces out of Ukraine is unlikely. Success is seen as reclaiming and holding key territory and dealing a blow to the Russian military. However, the Ukrainian army has struggled to dislodge Russian forces in recent months.

The Russian defensive fortifications, while extensive, may be vulnerable due to weaknesses in the Russian military, including poor combined arms operations, logistical problems, and low morale. Additionally, the expansive front line and the use of innovative technology, such as unmanned aircraft systems, could provide Ukraine with opportunities to exploit Russian vulnerabilities. Ukrainian forces have also demonstrated a strong will to fight and a proclivity for taking the initiative.

Rephrased and expanded question:<br>Will the Ukrainian military succeed in its operation to regain control of Polohy by October 1st, 2023, during the anticipated summer counteroffensive against Russian forces, considering the formidable defensive fortifications established by Russia, Ukraine's recent military preparations including new battalions and Western tanks, and the ongoing developments in the war?<br><br>2. Reasons why the answer might be no:<br>- Extensive Russian defensive fortifications: Russia has constructed a comprehensive three-line system of defensive measures, including trenches, minefields, and anti-tank obstacles that could significantly hinder Ukrainian advancement. (Strength: Strong)<br>- Mixed results of current counter-attacks: Recent Ukrainian counter-offensives have shown varying levels of success, suggesting that breaking through Russian defenses is a complex task. (Strength: Moderate)<br>- Possibility of protracted conflict: High casualties and the complexity of the offensive could result in a drawn-out conflict that extends beyond the October 1st deadline. (Strength: Moderate)<br>- Uncertainty in Western Support: The length of the conflict increases the risk of divisions among Ukraine’s allies, which could affect continuous support and success of the offensive. (Strength: Moderate)<br><br>3. Reasons why the answer might be yes:<br>- Commitment to counter-offensive: Ukraine's President Zelenskyy has confirmed the start of counter-offensive operations and there is evidence of active engagements in eastern and southern Ukraine. (Strength: Moderate)<br>- Ukrainian military strategy and morale: Ukraine's army has demonstrated initiative and resilience, which could translate into successful offensives. Additionally, they have been preparing with new battalions and Western weaponry. (Strength: Moderate)<br>- Exploitation of Russian military weaknesses: The Russian military has shown vulnerabilities, including logistical issues and low morale. Ukraine might exploit these weaknesses with innovative tech and tactics. (Strength: Moderate)<br>- International support: Ukraine continues to receive international support, including weapons and technology, which could bolster their offensive capabilities significantly. (Strength: Strong)<br><br>4. Aggregated considerations:<br>The outcome of Ukraine retaking Polohy is contingent upon several unpredictable factors: the effectiveness of Russian fortifications in deterring Ukrainian advances, the ongoing condition of Russian and Ukrainian combat capabilities and morale, the continued support of Ukraine by Western nations, and the actual conduct of counter-offensive operations. While there is clear intent from Ukraine and some demonstrated effectiveness in operations, the presence of strong Russian defenses and the complexity of warfare make it challenging to predict the success of such specific territorial gains within a set timeframe.<br><br>5. Initial probability (prediction):<br>Considering the strengths of the opposing forces and the dynamics of the current situation, there is a moderate chance of successful Ukrainian advancement. However, the formidable defensive structures of Russia cannot be overlooked.<br><br>6. Adjusted probability considerations:<br>Upon reflection, the calculated probability could be overestimating the Ukrainian capabilities given the strength of the Russian defenses. Additionally, there's also the factor of the unpredictable nature of warfare and political dynamics that may influence the conflict over the next few months.<br><br>7.

Rephrased and Expanded Question:<br>Given the current information on Ukraine's military capabilities, recent advancements in their army's development, and the evidence of a Russian fortified defense, what is the likelihood of Ukraine successfully executing a counteroffensive to regain control of Polohy by October 1, 2023? Consider factors such as Ukrainian access to Western tanks and AFVs, the initiation and progress of Ukraine's spring counteroffensive, the Russian military's defensive strategies, and any new developments that may influence the conflict's trajectory.<br><br>2. Decision Tree Outline:<br>- Ukraine launches counteroffensive<br>    - Ukrainian forces break through Russian defenses<br>        - Ukraine retakes Polohy (Yes)<br>        - Ukraine fails to retake Polohy (No)<br>    - Ukrainian forces do not break through Russian defenses (No)<br>- Ukraine does not launch counteroffensive (No)<br><br>3. Branch Probability Analysis:<br>- Ukrainian forces break through Russian defenses<br>    - Based on reports of fortified Russian defenses and previous mixed results of Ukrainian counterattacks, the probability might be moderate to low.<br>- Ukrainian forces fail to retake Polohy despite launching a counteroffensive<br>    - Similar to the first branch, but also acknowledging the uncertainty highlighted in reports about the effectiveness of Ukraine's offensive operations, could have a moderate to low probability.<br>- There is no actual launch of a counteroffensive<br>    - Reports suggest the counteroffensive is very likely already underway or imminent, so this might have a lower probability.<br><br>4. Discussion on Wildcards:<br>- Escalation or de-escalation by either party could significantly change the balance of power.<br>- The introduction of more advanced Western military technology could enhance Ukrainian capabilities.<br>- An unexpected political event, like a shift in leadership or alliances, may influence the military strategies and outcomes.<br>- Changes in the level of international support for Ukraine could also be a game-changer.<br>- If either side secures a new strategic partnership that offers military aid, it could alter the conflict's dynamic.<br><br>5. Initial Probability:<br>Given the fortifications and the mixed results of recent Ukrainian advances, but also considering their preparations and the international support they are receiving, an initial probability of success would not be extremely high.<br><br>6. Adjusted Probability Thoughts:<br>- The confidence level needs to check against overestimating the effectiveness of fortifications or underestimating the resolve and strategy of Ukrainian forces.<br>- If recent developments suggest weaknesses in the Russian defense that Ukraine could exploit, this might bump up the probability.<br>- Intuition suggests caution due to many unknowns and the complexity of warfare, with a leaning towards a conservative estimate.<br><br>7. Output Final Answer:<br>*0.40*</div></td>
