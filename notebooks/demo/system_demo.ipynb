      "Question: Will Reddit announce changes or a delay to its proposed API fee pricing before July 1, 2023?\n",
      "Background: In April 2023, Reddit announced new terms for its Application Programming Interface (API), the tool through which developers of third-party apps access Reddit's data. This change included the introduction of pricing for API usage, a significant departure from the previous practice of providing the API for free. This led to an outcry from both developers and users of third-party Reddit apps, as these changes could result in substantial costs for developers and the potential shutdown of many popular third-party apps.\n",
      "The developer of the popular third-party app, Apollo for Reddit, Christian Selig, stated he would be liable for an annual cost of $20 million under the new terms. This revelation sparked widespread discontent among Reddit users, leading to a coordinated protest involving more than 8,000 Reddit communities, including some of the largest and most active, going dark. Some communities have pledged to remain private indefinitely until Reddit makes changes.\n",
      "Reddit's CEO, Steve Huffman, has remained resolute regarding the API changes, emphasizing in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session and internal memos that the company must proceed with the changes. This stance is perceived as part of Reddit's broader effort to increase profitability, especially given the company's recent layoffs and plans to break even next year. However, the approach has escalated user dissatisfaction, with some speculating that the changes are an attempt to limit the viability of third-party apps and encourage users to migrate to the official Reddit app.\n",

      "[1] Reddit CEO lashes out on protests, moderators and third-party apps (published on 2023-06-16)\n",
      "Summary: Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is standing firm on API changes despite protests. The platform announced plans to charge for API access, sparking backlash from third-party app developers. The developer of Apollo for Reddit, Christian Selig, revealed that the new pricing could cost him $20 million annually, leading to widespread discontent. Huffman has defended the changes, emphasizing the need for profitability. Thousands of subreddits have gone dark in protest, but Huffman has shown no signs of backing down. The company has made exceptions for non-commercial apps, but the majority of third-party developers are facing potential shutdown. Despite the uproar, Huffman has indicated that Reddit is unlikely to make changes to the pricing structure.\n",

      "[2] Reddit CEO compares moderators to aristocracy as blackout stretches on (published on 2023-06-16)\n",
      "Summary: Reddit CEO Steve Huffman is facing backlash over the company's plans to charge for third-party app access to its data. The move has prompted a mass protest, with more than 8,000 Reddit communities going dark. Huffman has compared the unpaid volunteer moderators leading the blackout to wealthy land barons and downplayed concerns about the protest. However, the protest has caused Reddit to crash temporarily, and some moderators have indicated their subreddits will remain blacked out indefinitely. The blackout is occurring at a crucial time for the social media giant, which was valued at $10 billion when it landed $1 billion in fundraising in August 2021. Huffman has faced blowback for how the company has handled the decision to charge for data, and the blackout has caused significant trouble for the company. Some moderators have said they are prepared to remain private or otherwise inaccessible indefinitely until Reddit provides an adequate solution. As the July 1 change approaches, how long the blackout will last is unclear. The protest is not currently likely to end very soon.\n",

      "Summary: Reddit announced new API pricing in April 2023, sparking backlash from developers and users of third-party apps. The changes could result in substantial costs and potential shutdowns of popular apps. CEO Steve Huffman has remained firm on the changes, emphasizing the need for profitability. This led to widespread discontent and a protest involving over 8,000 Reddit communities going dark. Some communities plan to stay private until Reddit makes changes. The company's stance has escalated user dissatisfaction, with speculation that the changes aim to limit third-party app viability. Given the backlash, it's uncertain whether Reddit will announce changes or a delay to the proposed API fee pricing before July 1, 2023.\n",
